<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The following pages embrace the substance of the narratives
of two distinct expeditions for the discovery of the sources of the
Mississippi River, under the authority of the United States. By
connecting the incidents of discovery, and of the facts brought
to light during a period of twelve years, unity is preserved in
the prosecution of an object of considerable importance in the
progress of our geography and natural history, at least, from the
new impulse which they received after the treaty of Ghent.</p>

<p>Geographers deem that branch of a river as its true source
which originates at the remotest distance from its mouth, and,
agreeably to this definition, the combined narratives, to which
attention is now called, show this celebrated stream to arise in
Itasca Lake, the source of the Itasca River.</p>

<p>Owing to the time which has intervened since these expeditions
were undertaken, a mere revision of the prior narrations, in the
<i>journal form</i>, was deemed inexpedient. A concise summary has,
therefore, been made, preserving whatever information it was
thought important to be known or remembered, and omitting all
matters not partaking of permanent interest.</p>

<p>To this summary, something has been added from the original
manuscript journals in his possession. The domestic organization
and social habits of the parties may thus be more perfectly
understood. The sympathies which bind men together in isolated
or trying scenes are sources of interest long after the link
is severed, and the progress of science or discovery has passed
beyond the particular points at which they then stood. Events
pass with so much rapidity at present, in the diffusion of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
population over regions where, but lately, the Indian was the
only tenant, that we are in danger of having but a confused record
of them, if not of losing it altogether. It is some abatement
of this fear to know that there is always a portion of the community
who take a pleasure in remembering individuals; who
have either ventured their lives, or exerted their energies, to promote
knowledge or advance discovery. It is in this manner that,
however intent an age may be in the plans which engross it, the
sober progress and attainments of the period are counted up. An
important fact discovered in the physical geography or natural
history of the country, if it be placed on record, remains a fact
added to the permanent stores of information. A new plant, a
crystal, an insect, or the humblest invertebrate object of the zoological
chain, is as incontestable an addition to scientific knowledge,
as the finding of remains to establish a new species of
mastodon. They only differ in interest and importance.</p>

<p>It is not the province of every age to produce a Linnæus, a
Buffon, or a Cuvier; but, such are the almost endless forms of
vegetable and animal life and organization&mdash;from the infusoria
upward&mdash;that not a year elapses which may not enlarge the
boundaries of science. The record of discovery is perpetually
accumulating, and filling the list of discoverers with humbler, yet
worthy names. Whoever reads with care the scientific desiderata
here offered will find matter of description or comment which has
employed the pens of a Torrey, a Mitchell, a Cooper, a Lea, a
Barnes, a Houghton, and a Nicollet.</p>

<p>It is from considerations of this nature, that the author has
appended to this narrative the original observations, reports, and
descriptions made by his companions or himself, while engaged in
these exploratory journeys, together with the determinations made
on such scientific objects as were referred to other competent
hands. These investigations of the physical geography of the
West, and the phenomena or resources of the country, constitute,
indeed, by far the most important permanent acquisitions of the
scrutiny devoted to them. They form the elements of classes of
facts which will retain their value, to men of research, when the
incidents of the explorations are forgotten, and its actors themselves
have passed to their final account.</p>

<p>It would have been desirable that what has here been done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
should have been done at an earlier period; but it may be sufficient
to say that other objects engrossed the attention of the author
for no small part of the intervening period, and that he could not
earlier control the circumstances which the publication demanded.
After his permanent return from the West&mdash;where so many years
of his life passed&mdash;it was his first wish to accomplish a long-cherished
desire of visiting England and the Continent, in which
America, and its manners and institutions, might be contemplated
at a distance, and compared by ocular proofs. And, when he determined
on the task of preparing this volume, and began to look
around for the companions of his travels, to avail himself of their
notes, he found most of them had descended to the tomb. For the
narrative parts, indeed, the manuscript journals, kept with great
fulness, were still preserved; but the materials for the other division
of the work were widely scattered. Some of them remained in the
archives of the public offices to which they were originally communicated.
Other papers had been given to the pages of scientific
journals, and their reprint was inexpedient. The rich body of
topographical data, and the elaborately drawn map of this portion
of the United States, prepared by Captain Douglass, U. S. A.,
which would have been received with avidity at the time, had
been in a great measure superseded by subsequent discoveries.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[1]</a>
The only part of this officer's observations employed in this work,
are his determinations of the geographical positions. The latter
have been extended and perfected by the subsequent observations
of Mr. Nicollet. At every point, there have been difficulties to
overcome. He has been strenuous to award justice to his deceased
companions, to whose memory he is attached by the ties of sympathy
and former association. If more time has elapsed in preparing
the work than was anticipated, it is owing to the nature
of it; and he can only say that still more time and attention would
be required to do justice to it.</p>

A word may be added respecting the period of these explorations.
The year 1820 marked a time of much activity in geographical
discovery in the United States. The treaty of Ghent, a
few years before, had relieved the frontiers from a most sanguinary
Indian war. This event enlarged the region for settlement, and
created an intense desire for information respecting the new
countries. Government had, indeed, at an earlier period, shown
a disposition to aid and encourage discoveries. The feeling on
this subject cannot be well understood, without allusion to the
name of John Ledyard. This intrepid traveller had accompanied
Captain Cook on his last voyage round the world. In 1786, he
presented himself to Mr. Jefferson, the American minister at Paris,
with a plan of extensive explorations. He proposed to set out
from St. Petersburg, and, passing through Russia and Tartary to
Behring's Straits, to traverse the north Pacific to Oregon, and
thence cross the Rocky Mountains to the Missouri Valley.[A] Mr.
Jefferson communicated the matter to the Russian plenipotentiary
at Paris&mdash;and to the Baron Grimm, the confidential agent of the
Empress Catherine&mdash;through whose influence he received the required
passports. He proceeded on this adventure, and had reached
within two hundred miles of Kamschatka, where he was arrested,
and taken back, in a close carriage, to Moscow, and thence conducted
to the frontiers of Poland. On reaching London, the
African Association selected him to make explorations in the
direction of the Niger. Reaching Egypt, he proceeded up the
Nile to Cairo, where, having completed his preparations for entering
the interior of Africa, he sickened and died, in the month of
November, 1788.&mdash;<i>Life of Ledyard</i>, Sparks's <i>Amer. Biog.</i> vol. xvi.</p>

<p>The suggestion of Ledyard to explore Oregon became the germ
of the voyages of Lewis and Clark. It appears that, in 1792, Mr.
Jefferson proposed the subject to the American Philosophical
Society at Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[2]</a> It is not known that its action resulted
in anything practical. After Mr. Jefferson himself, however, came
to the presidency, in 1801, he called the attention of Congress to
the matter. Louisiana had been acquired, under his auspices, in
1803, which furnished a strong public reason for its exploration.
To conduct it, he selected his private secretary and relative, Merriweather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Lewis, of Virginia; Captain William Clark was named
as his assistant. Both these gentlemen were commissioned in the
army, and the expense thus placed on a public basis. Captain
Lewis left the city of Washington, on this enterprise, on the 5th
of July, 1803, and was joined by Captain Clark west of the Alleghanies.
Having organized the expedition at St. Louis, they
began the ascent of the Missouri River on the 14th of May, 1804.
They wintered the first year at Fort Mandan, about 1,800 miles
up the Missouri, in the country of the Mandans. Crossing the
Rocky Mountains the next year, and descending the Columbia to
the open shore of the Pacific, they retraced their general course to
the waters of the Missouri, in 1806, and returned to St. Louis on the
23d of September of that year. (<i>Lewis and Clark</i>, vol. ii. p. 433.)</p>

<p>To explore the Missouri to its source, and leave the remote
summits of the Mississippi untouched, would seem to have ill-accorded
with Mr. Jefferson's conceptions. It does not appear,
however, from published data, that he selected the person to
perform the latter service, leaving it to the military commandant
of the district. (<i>Life of Pike</i>, Sparks's <i>Amer. Biog.</i> vol. xv.
pp. 220, 281.) General Wilkinson, who had been directed to
occupy Louisiana, appears to have made the selection. He designated
Lieutenant Zebulon Montgomery Pike. This officer left
Bellefontaine, Missouri, on the 9th of August, 1805, with a total
force of twenty men, at least four months too late in the season
to reach even the central part of his destination, without an aid
in the command, without a scientific observer of any description,
and without even an interpreter to communicate with the Indians.
That he should have accomplished what he did, is altogether
owing to his activity, vigilance, and enterprise, his knowledge of
hunting and forest life, and his well-established habits of mental and
military discipline. Winter overtook him, on the 16th of October,
in his ascent, when he was about one hundred and twenty miles
(as now ascertained) above the Falls of St. Anthony.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[3]</a> Severe
cold, snow, and ice, rendered it impossible to push his boats further.
Devoting twelve days in erecting a blockhouse, and leaving
his heavy stores and disabled men in charge of a non commissioned
officer, he proceeded onwards, on snow shoes, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>small hand-sledges, and, by great energy and perseverance,
reached, at successive periods, Sandy Lake, Leach Lake, and
Upper Red Cedar Lake, on the third great plateau at the sources
of the Mississippi. On the opening of the river, he began his
descent, and returned to his starting-point, at Bellefontaine, on the
30th of April, 1806, having been absent a little less than nine
months. On his visiting the country above the point where the
climate arrested his advance, the whole region was found to be
clothed in a mantle of snow. On his journey, the deer, elk,
buffalo, and wolf, were found on the prairies&mdash;the waters were
inhabited by wild fowl; as he acted the part of hunter, and, to
some extent, guide, these furnished abundant employ for his efficient
sportsman-like propensities. Of its distinctive zoology,
minerals, plants, and other physical desiderata, it was not in his
power, had he been ever so well prepared, to make observations.
Even for the topography, above the latitude of about 46°, he was
dependent, essentially, on the information furnished by the factors
of the Northwest British Fur Company, who, at that period, occupied
the country.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[4]</a> This information was readily given, and enabled
him, with general accuracy, to present the maps and descriptions
which accompany his account of the region. He was,
however, misled in placing the source of the river in Turtle
Lake, and in the topography of the region south and west of that
point.</p>

<p>Pike's account of his expedition did not issue from the press
till 1810. The narrative of the expedition of Lewis and Clark
was still longer delayed&mdash;owing to the melancholy death of
Lewis&mdash;and was not given till 1814; a period of political commotion
by no means favorable to literary matters. It was, however,
at once hailed as a valuable and standard accession to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
geographical science. Public opinion had for years been called
to this daring enterprise.</p>

<p>Such was the state of geographical discovery in the United
States in 1816. The war with Great Britain had had an exhausting
effect upon the resources and fiscal condition of the country.
But, owing to the information gained by the operation of armies
in the ample area west of the Alleghanies, it opened a new world
for enterprise in that quarter. The treaty of 1814 with Great
Britain, which affirmed the original boundaries of 1783, by terminating,
at the same time, the war and the fallacious hopes of
sovereignty set up for the Indian tribes, truly opened the Mississippi
Valley to settlement.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned to the general climate of the West, and
its capacities of growth and expansion. The universal ardor
which then arose and was spread, of its fertility, extent, and resources,
has, from that era, filled the public mind, and fixed the
liveliest hopes of the extension of the Union.</p>

<p>The accession of Mr. Monroe to the presidency, 4th March,
1817, formed the opening of this new epoch of industrial empire
and progress in the West. This period brought into the administration
a man of great grasp of intellect and energy of character
in Mr. Calhoun. By placing the army in a series of self-sustaining
posts on the frontiers, in advance of the settlements, he gave
them efficient protection against the still feverish tribes, who
hovered&mdash;feeble and dejected from the results of the war, but in
broken, discordant, and hostile masses&mdash;around the long and still
dangerous line of the frontiers, from Florida to Detroit and the
Falls of St. Anthony. He encouraged every means of acquiring
true information of its geography and resources. In 1819, the
military line was extended to Council Bluffs, on the Missouri,
and to the Falls of St. Anthony, on the Mississippi. Major S. H.
Long, of the Topographical Engineers, was directed to ascend the
Missouri, for the purpose of exploring the region west to the
Rocky Mountains. During the same year, he approved a plan
for exploring the sources of the Mississippi, submitted by General
Cass, who occupied the northwestern frontiers.</p>

<p>The author having then returned from the exploration of the
Ozark Highlands, and the mine country of Missouri and Arkansas,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[5]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
received from Mr. Calhoun the appointment of geologist
and mineralogist on this expedition; and having, at a subsequent
period, been selected, as the leader of the expedition of 1832, to
resume and complete the discoveries under the same authority,
commenced in 1820, it is to the journals and notes kept on these
separate occasions, that he is indebted for the data of the narratives
and for the body of information now submitted.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Charlevoix informs us that the discovery of the Mississippi
River is due to father Marquette, a Jesuit missionary, who manifested
the most unwearied enterprise in exploring the north-western
regions of New France; and after laying the foundation
of Michilimackinac, proceeded, in company with Sieur Joliet, up
the Fox River of Green Bay, and, crossing the portage into the
Wisconsin, first entered the Mississippi in 1673.</p>

<p>Robert de la Salle, to whom the merit of this discovery is generally
attributed, embarked at Rochelle, on his first voyage of discovery,
July 14, 1678; reached Quebec in September following,
and, proceeding up the St. Lawrence, laid the foundation of Fort
Niagara, in the country of the Iroquois, late in the fall of that
year. In the following year, he passes up the Niagara River;
estimates the height of the falls at six hundred feet; and proceeding
through Lakes Erie, St. Clair, and Huron, reaches Michilimackinac
in August. He then visits the Sault de St. Marie, and
returning to Michilimackinac, continues his voyage to the south,
with a view of striking the Mississippi River; passes into the lake
of the Illinois; touches at Green Bay; and enters the River St.
Joseph's, of Lake Michigan, where he builds a fort, in the country
of the Miamies.</p>

<p>In December of the same year, he crosses the portage between
the St. Joseph's and the Illinois; descends the latter to the lake,
and builds a fort in the midst of the tribes of the Illinois, which
he calls Crevec&oelig;ur. Here he makes a stand; sends persons out
to explore the Mississippi, traffics with the Indians, among all of
whom he finds abundance of Indian corn; and returns to Fort
Frontenac, on Lake Ontario, in 1680. He revisits Fort Crevec&oelig;ur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
late in the autumn of the following year, and finally descends the
Illinois, to its junction with the Mississippi, and thence to the
embouchure of the latter in the Gulf of Mexico, where he arrives
on the 7th of April, 1683, and calculates the latitude between 23°
and 24° north.</p>

<p>The Spaniards had previously sought in vain for the mouth of
this stream, and bestowed upon it, in anticipation, the name of
Del Rio Ascondido. La Salle now returns to Quebec, by way of
the Lakes, and from thence to France, where he is well received
by the king, who grants him an outfit of four ships, and two
hundred men, to enable him to continue his discoveries, and found
a colony in the newly discovered territories. He leaves Rochelle
in July, 1684, reaches the Bay of St. Louis, which is fifty leagues
south of the Mississippi, in the Gulf of Mexico, in February following,
where he builds a fort, founds a settlement, and is finally
assassinated by one of his own party. The exertions of this enterprising
individual, and the account which was published of his
discoveries by the Chevalier Tonti, who had accompanied him in
all his perilous expeditions, had a greater effect, in the French
capital, in producing a correct estimate of the extent, productions,
and importance of the Canadas, than all that had been done by
preceding tourists; and this may be considered as the true era,
when the eyes of politicians and divines, merchants and speculators,
were first strongly turned towards the boundless forests, the
sublime rivers and lakes, the populous Indian tribes, and the profitable
commerce of New France.</p>

<p>Father Louis Hennepin was a missionary of the Franciscan order
of Catholics, who accompanied La Salle on his first voyage from
France; and after the building of Fort Crevec&oelig;ur, on the Illinois,
was dispatched in company with three French voyageurs to explore
the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>They departed from Fort Crevec&oelig;ur on the 29th of February,
1680, and dropping down the Illinois to its junction with the
Mississippi, followed the latter an indeterminate distance towards
the Gulf, not believed to be great, where they left some memorial
of their visit, and immediately commenced their return. When
they had proceeded up the Mississippi a hundred and fifty
leagues above the confluence of the Illinois, they were taken
prisoners by some Indian tribes, and carried towards its sources
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
nineteen days' journey into the territories of the Naudowessies
and Issati, where they were detained in captivity three or four
months, and then suffered to return. The account which Hennepin
published of his travels and discoveries, served to throw
some new light upon the topography, and the Indian tribes of the
Canadas; and modern geography is indebted to him for the names
which he bestowed upon the Falls of St. Anthony and the River
St. Francis.</p>

<p>In 1703, the Baron La Hontan, an unfrocked monk, published,
in London, his voyages to North America, the result of a residence
of six years in the Canadas. La Hontan served as an
officer in the French army, and first went out to Quebec in 1683.
During the succeeding four years he was chiefly stationed at
Chambly, Fort Frontenac, Niagara, St. Joseph, at the foot of
Lake Huron, and the Sault de St. Marie.</p>

<p>He arrives at Michilimackinac in 1688, and there first hears of
the assassination of La Salle. In 1689 he visits Green Bay, and
passes through the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers into the Mississippi.
So far, his work appears to be the result of actual observation,
and is entitled to respect; but what he relates of Long River
appears wholly incredible, and can only be regarded as some
flight of the imagination, intended to gratify the public taste for
travels, during an age when it had been highly excited by the
extravagant accounts which had been published respecting the
wealth, population, and advantages of Peru, Mexico, the English
and Dutch colonies, New France, the Illinois, and various other
parts of the New World.</p>

<p>To convey some idea of this part of the Baron's work, it will
be sufficient to observe that after travelling ten days above the
mouth of the Wisconsin, he arrives at the mouth of a large stream,
which he calls Long River, and which he ascends eighty-four days
successively, during which he meets with numerous tribes of
savages, as the Eskoros, Essenapes, Pinnokas, Mozemleeks, &amp;c.
He is attended a part of the way by five or six hundred, as an
escort; sees at one time two thousand savages upon the shore; and
states the population of the Essenapes at 20,000 souls; but this tribe
is still inferior to the Mozemleeks in numbers, in arts, and in every
other prerequisite for a great people. "The Mozemleek nation,"
he observes, "is numerous and puissant. The four slaves of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
country informed me that, at the distance of 150 leagues from
the place where I then was, their principal river empties itself into
a salt lake of three hundred leagues in circumference, the mouth
of which is about two leagues broad; that the lower part of that
river is adorned with six noble cities, surrounded with stone,
cemented with fat earth; that the houses of these cities have no
roofs, but are open above like a platform; that, besides the above-mentioned
cities, there are an hundred towns, great and small,
round that sort of sea; that the people of that country make
stuffs, copper axes, and several other manufactures, &amp;c."</p>

<p>In 1721, P. De Charlevoix, the historian of New France, was
commissioned by the French Government to make a tour of observation
through the Canadas, and in addition to his topographical
and historical account of New France, published a journal of his
voyage through the Lakes. He was one of the most learned divines
of his age, and although strongly tinctured with the doctrines of
fatality, and disposed to view everything relative to the Indian
tribes with the over-zealous eye of a Catholic missionary, yet his
works bear the impress of a strong and well-cultivated mind, and
abound in philosophical reflections, enlarged views, and accurate
deductions; and, notwithstanding the lapse of a century, he must
still be regarded as the most polished and illustrious traveller of
the region. He first landed at Quebec in the spring of 1721, and
immediately proceeded up the St. Lawrence to Fort Frontenac and
Niagara, where he corrects the error into which those who preceded
him had fallen, with respect to the height of the cataract.
He proceeds through Lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan, descends
the Illinois and Mississippi to New Orleans, then recently settled,
and embarks for France. The period of his visit was that, when
the Mississippi Scheme was in the height of experiment, and excited
the liveliest interest in the French metropolis; people were then
engaged, in Louisiana, in exploring every part of the country,
under the delusive hope of finding rich mines of gold and silver;
and the remarks he makes upon the probability of a failure, were
shortly justified by the event.</p>

<p>In 1760, Alexander Henry, Esq. visited the upper lakes, in
the character of a trader, and devoted sixteen years to travelling
over different parts of the north-western region of the Canadas
and the United States. The result of his observations upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
topography, Indian tribes, and natural history of the country,
was first published in 1809, and, as a volume of travels and
adventures, is a valuable acquisition to our means of information.
This work abounds in just and sensible reflections upon
scenes, situations, and objects of the most interesting kind, and
is written in a style of the most charming perspicuity and simplicity.
He was the first English traveller of the region.</p>

<p>The date of Carver's travels over those regions is 1766. Carver,
whose travels have been treated with too indiscriminate censure,
was descended from an ancient and respectable English family in
Connecticut, and had served as a captain in the provincial army,
which was disbanded after the treaty of peace of Versailles, of
1763, and united to great personal courage a persevering and observing
mind. By his bravery and admirable conduct among
the powerful tribes of Sioux and Chippewas, he obtained a high
standing among them; and, after being constituted a chief by the
former, received from them a large grant of land, which was not,
however, ratified by the British government. The fate of this
enterprising traveller cannot but excite regret. After having
escaped the massacre of Fort William Henry, on the banks of
Lake George, in 1757, and the perils of a long journey through
the American wilderness, he was spared to endure miseries in
the heart of the British metropolis, which he had never encountered
in the huts of the American savages, and perished of want
in the city of London, the seat of literature and opulence!</p>

<p>Between the years 1769 and 1772, Samuel Hearne performed
a journey from Prince of Wales's Fort, in Hudson's Bay, to the
Coppermine River of the Arctic Ocean. McKenkie's voyages to
the Frozen and Pacific Oceans were performed in 1789 and 1793.
Pike ascended the Mississippi in 1805 and 1806.</p>

<p>Such is a brief outline of the progress of discovery in the
north-western regions of the United States, by which our sources
of information have been from time to time augmented, and additional
light cast upon the interesting history of our Indian
tribes&mdash;their numbers and condition, and other particulars connected
with the regions they inhabit. Still, it cannot be denied
that, amidst much sound and useful information, there has been
mingled no inconsiderable proportion that is deceptive, hypothetical,
or false; and, upon the whole, that the progress of information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
has not kept pace with the increased importance which
that section of the Union has latterly assumed&mdash;with the great
improvements of society&mdash;and with the spirit and the enterprise
of the times. A new era has dawned in the moral history of our
country, and, no longer satisfied with mere geographical outlines
and boundaries, its physical productions, its antiquities, and the
numerous other traits which it presents for scientific research,
already attract the attention of a great proportion of the reading
community; and it is eagerly inquired of various sections of it&mdash;whose
trade, whose agriculture, and whose population have been
long known&mdash;what are its indigenous plants, its zoology, its
geology, its mineralogy, &amp;c. Of no part of it, however, has the
paucity of information upon these, and upon other and more
familiar subjects, been so great, as of the extreme north-western
regions of the Union, of the great chain of lakes, and of the
sources of the Mississippi River, which have continued to be the
subject of dispute between geographical writers.</p>

<p>Impressed with the importance of these facts, Governor Cass,
of Michigan, projected, in the fall of 1819, an expedition for exploring
the regions in question, and presented a memorial to the
Secretary of War upon the subject, in which he proposed leaving
Detroit the ensuing spring, in Indian canoes, as being best adapted
to the navigation of the shallow waters of the upper country, and
to the numerous portages which it is necessary to make from
stream to stream.</p>

<p>The specific objects of this journey were to obtain a more correct
knowledge of the names, numbers, customs, history, condition,
mode of subsistence, and dispositions of the Indian tribes;
to survey the topography of the country, and collect the materials
for an accurate map; to locate the site and purchase the
ground for a garrison at the foot of Lake Superior; to investigate
the subject of the north-western copper mines, lead mines, and
gypsum quarries, and to purchase from the Indian tribes such
tracts as might be necessary to secure to the United States the
ultimate advantages to be derived from them. To accomplish
these objects, it was proposed to attach to the expedition a topographical
engineer, an astronomer, a physician, and a mineralogist
and geologist, and some other scientific observers.</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun not only approved of the proposed plan, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
determined to enable the governor to carry it into complete effect,
by ordering an escort of soldiers, and enjoining it upon the commandants
of the frontier garrisons, to furnish every aid that the
exigencies of the party might require, either in men, boats, or
supplies.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to add, that I was honored with the appointment
of mineralogist and geologist to the expedition, in
which capacity I kept the following journal. In presenting it to
the public, it will not be deemed improper if I acknowledge the
obligations which I have incurred in transcribing it, by availing
myself of a free access to the valuable library of His Excellency
De Witt Clinton, and of the taste and skill of Mr. Henry Inman,
in drawing a number of the views which embellish the work.</p>

<h2>PRELIMINARY DOCUMENTS.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, November 18, 1819.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The country upon the southern shore of Lake Superior,
and upon the water communication between that Lake and the
Mississippi, has been but little explored, and its natural features
are imperfectly known. We have no correct topographical delineation
of it, and the little information we possess relating to it
has been derived from the reports of the Indian traders.</p>

<p>It has occurred to me that a tour through that country, with
a view to examine the productions of its animal, vegetable, and
mineral kingdoms, to explore its facilities for water communication,
to delineate its natural objects, and to ascertain its present
and future probable value, would not be uninteresting in itself,
nor useless to the Government. Such an expedition would not
be wholly unimportant in the public opinion, and would well
accord with that zeal for inquiries of this nature which has recently
marked the administration of the War Department.</p>

<p>But, however interesting such a tour might be in itself, or
however important in its result, either in a political or geographical
point of view, I should not have ventured to suggest the
subject, nor to solicit your permission to carry it into effect, were
it not, in other respects, intimately connected with the discharge
of my official duties.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbridge, the delegate from this Territory, at my request,
takes charge of this letter, and he is so intimately acquainted
with the subject, and every way so competent to enter into any
explanations you may require, that I shall not be compelled to
go as much into detail as, under other circumstances, might be
necessary.</p>

<p>The route which I propose to take, is from here to Michilimackinac,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and from thence, by the Straits of St. Mary's, to
the river which contains the body of copper ore (specimens of
which have been transmitted to the Government), and to the extremity
of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>From that point, up the river which forms the water communication
between that lake and the Mississippi, to the latter river,
and, by the way of Prairie du Chien and Green Bay, to Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p>The political objects which require attention upon this route
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A personal examination of the different Indian tribes who
occupy the country; of their moral and social condition; of their
feelings towards the United States; of their numerical strength;
and of the various objects connected with them, of which humanity
and sound policy require that the Government should
possess an intimate knowledge. We are very little acquainted
with these Indians, and I indulge the expectation that such a
visit would be productive of beneficial effects.</p>

<p>The extract from the letter of Colonel Leavenworth, herewith
inclosed, and the speech of the Winnebago Indians, transmitted
to the War Department by Mr. Graham, from Rock Island, February
24, 1819, will show how much we have yet to learn respecting
these tribes, which are comparatively near to us.</p>

<p>2. Another important object is, to procure the extinction of
Indian titles to the land in the vicinity of the Straits of St. Mary's,
Prairie du Chien, Green Bay, and upon the communication between
the two latter places.</p>

<p>I will not trouble you with any observations respecting the
necessity of procuring these cessions. They are the prominent
points of the country&mdash;the avenues of communication by which
alone it can be approached.</p>

<p>Two of them&mdash;Prairie du Chien and Green Bay&mdash;are occupied
by a considerable population, and the Straits of St. Mary's by a
few families. The undefined nature of their rights and duties,
and the uncertain tenure by which they hold their lands, render
it important that some step should be taken by the Government
to relieve them. I think, too, that a cession of territory, with a
view to immediate sale and settlement, would be highly important
in the event of any difficulties with the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
My experience at Indian treaties convinces me that reasonable
cessions, upon proper terms, may at any time be procured. At
the treaty recently concluded at Saginaw, the Indians were willing
to cede the country in the vicinity of Michilimackinac, but I
did not feel authorized to treat with them for it.</p>

<p>Upon this subject, I transmit extracts from the letters of Mr.
Boyd and Colonel Bowyer, by which it will be seen that these
gentlemen anticipate no difficulty in procuring these cessions.</p>

<p>3. Another important object is the examination of the body
of copper in the vicinity of Lake Superior. As early as the year
1800, Mr. Tracy, then a senator from Connecticut, was dispatched
to make a similar examination. He, however, proceeded no farther
than Michilimackinac. Since then, several attempts have
been made, which have proved abortive. The specimens of
virgin copper which have been sent to the seat of Government
have been procured by the Indians, or by the half-breeds, from a
large mass, represented to weigh many tons, which has fallen
from the brow of a hill.</p>

<p>I anticipate no difficulty in reaching the spot, and it may be
highly important to the Government to divide this mass, and to
transport it to the seaboard for naval purposes.</p>

<p>It is also important to examine the neighboring country, which
is said to be rich in its mineral productions.</p>

<p>I should propose that the land in the vicinity of this river be
purchased of the Indians. It could doubtless be done upon reasonable
terms, and the United States could then cause a complete
examination of it to be made.</p>

<p>Such a cession is not unimportant in another point of view.
Some persons have already begun to indulge in speculations upon
this subject. The place is remote, and the means of communicating
with it are few. By timely presents to the Indians, illegal
possessions might be gained, and much injury might be done,
much time might elapse, and much difficulty be experienced,
before such trespassers could be removed.</p>

<p>4. To ascertain the views of the Indians in the vicinity of
Chicago, respecting the removal of the Six Nations to that district
of country, an extract from the letter of Mr. Kenzie, sub-agent at
Chicago, upon this subject, will show the situation in which this
business stands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
5. To explain to the Indians the views of the Government
respecting their intercourse with the British authorities at Malden,
and distinctly to announce to them that their visits must be discontinued.</p>

<p>It is probable that the annunciation of the new system which
you have directed to be pursued upon this subject, and the explanations
connected with it, can be made with more effect by
me than by ordinary messengers.</p>

<p>6. To ascertain the state of the British fur trade within that
part of our jurisdiction. Our information upon this subject is
very limited, while its importance requires that it should be fully
known.</p>

<p>In addition to these objects, I think it very important to carry
the flag of the United States into those remote regions, where it
has never been borne by any person in a public station.</p>

<p>The means by which I propose to accomplish this tour are
simple and economical. All that will be required is an ordinary
birch canoe, and permission to employ a competent number of
Canadian boatmen. The whole expense will be confined within
narrow limits, and no appropriation will be necessary to defray
it. I only request permission to assign to this object a small
part of the sum apportioned for Indian expenditures at this place,
say from 1,000 to 1,500 dollars.</p>

<p>If, however, the Government should think that a small display
of force might be proper, an additional canoe, to be manned with
active soldiers, and commanded by an intelligent officer, would
not increase the expense, and would give greater effect to any
representations which might be made to the Indians.</p>

<p>An intelligent officer of engineers, to make a correct chart
for the information of the Government, would add to the value of
the expedition.</p>

<p>I am not competent to speculate upon the natural history of the
country through which we may pass. Should this object be deemed
important, I request that some person acquainted with zoology,
botany, and mineralogy may be sent to join me.</p>

<p>It is almost useless to add that I do not expect any compensation
for my own services, except the ordinary allowance for negotiating
Indian treaties, should you think proper to direct any to
be held, and intrust the charge of them to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
I request that you will communicate to me, as early as convenient,
your determination upon this subject, as it will be necessary to
prepare a canoe during the winter, to be ready to enter upon the
tour as soon as the navigation of the Lakes is open, should you
think proper to approve the plan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have received your letters of the 18th and 21st November
last. The exploring tour you propose has the sanction of the
Government, provided the expenditure can be made out of the
sum allotted your superintendency for Indian affairs, adding thereto
one thousand dollars for that special purpose.</p>

<p>The objects of this expedition are comprised under the five
heads stated in your letter of the 18th of November, and which
you will consider&mdash;with the exception of that part which relates to
holding Indian treaties, upon which you will be fully instructed
hereafter&mdash;as forming part of the instructions which may be given
you by this Department.</p>

<p>Should your reconnoissance extend to the western extremity of
Lake Superior, you will ascertain the practicability of a communication
between the Bad, or Burntwood River, which empties
into the Lake, and the Copper, or St. Croix, which empties into
the Mississippi, and the facility they present for a communication
with our posts on the St. Peter's.</p>

<p>The Montreal rivers will also claim your attention, with a view
of establishing, through them, a communication between Green
Bay and the west end of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>To aid you in the accomplishment of these important objects,
some officers of Topographical Engineers will be ordered to join
you. Perhaps Major Long, now here, will be directed to take
that route to join the expedition which he commands up the
Missouri. In that event, a person acquainted with zoology and
botany will be selected to accompany him. Feeling, as I do, great
interest in obtaining a correct topographical, geographical, and
military survey of our country, every encouragement, consistent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with the means in my power, will be given by the Department.
To this end, General Macomb will be ordered to afford you every
facility you may require.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Mr. Schoolcraft, a gentleman of science and observation,
and particularly skilled in mineralogy, has applied to me to be
permitted to accompany you on your exploring tour upon Lake
Superior. I have directed him to report to you, for that duty,
under the belief that he will be highly useful to you, as well as
serviceable to the Government and the promotion of science.</p>

<p>You will furnish him with the necessary supplies and accommodation
while employed, and every facility necessary to enable him
to obtain a knowledge of the mineralogy of the country as far as
practicable.</p>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, March 10, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 17th ult., inclosing a copy of a letter from Giles Sanford
&amp; Co.</p>

<p>Their statement with respect to the discovery of plaster of
Paris upon one or more of the islands in the vicinity of Michilimackinac,
to which the Indian title has not been extinguished, is
correct. Specimens of this plaster have been brought here, and
it is reported, by competent judges, to be of the best and purest
kind. The quantity is stated to be inexhaustible, and, as vessels
generally return empty, or nearly so, from the upper lakes, it
could be transported to any part of Lake Erie at a trifling expense.</p>

<p>I have great doubts, however, whether it would be proper for
the Government to grant any permission to remove this plaster
until the Indian title to the land is extinguished. The power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
granting permission for that purpose is not given in the "act to
regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve
peace on the frontiers," and appears, in fact, to be inconsistent
with its general spirit and objects. To authorize these
gentlemen to negotiate with the Indians for such a permission, is
contrary to the settled policy which has always been pursued by
the United States. I know of no case in which individuals have
been or should be permitted to hold any councils with the Indians,
except to procure the extinction of their title to lands,
claimed under grants from one of the States. The application
here must be to the tribe, because in all their land there is a community
of interest, which cannot be severed or conveyed by the
acts of individuals.</p>

<p>But, independent of precedent, there are strong objections to
this course in principle. If private persons are authorized to
open such negotiations for any object, the Government will find
it very difficult to procure from the Indians any cession of land
upon reasonable terms.</p>

<p>Were these islands the property of the United States, I think
it would be very proper to permit the plaster upon them to be
removed by every person making application for that purpose.
The supply being inexhaustible, the agricultural interest would
be greatly promoted by such a measure, and the dependence upon
a foreign country for this important article would be removed.</p>

<p>I therefore take the liberty of recommending that a cession of
these islands be procured by the United States from the Indians.
I presume that this may be done without the payment of any
annuity to them, and without any expense, except, perhaps, a
few trifling presents. The plaster would then be at the disposal
of Government, and its free distribution, under such regulations
as might be adopted to prevent disputes between the adventurers,
or a monopoly by any of them, would be equally proper and
beneficial.</p>

<p>Extract of a letter from the Secretary of War to Governor
Lewis Cass, dated</p>

<p class="date">April 5, 1820.</p>

<p>Sir: I have received your letters of the 10th, 11th, and 17th
ultimo. In relation to procuring cessions of land from the
Indians, the Government has decided that it would be inexpedient
to obtain any farther extinguishment of Indian title, except at the
Sault de St. Marie, where it is the wish of the Department, that
an inconsiderable cession, not exceeding ten miles square (unless
strong reasons for a greater cession should present themselves
from an actual inspection of the country), should be acquired
upon the most reasonable terms, so as to comprehend the proposed
military position there.</p>

<p>Herewith you will receive a plate of the country about the
Sault de St. Marie, on which is indicated the military site intended
to be occupied for defence. You will also procure the cession of
the islands containing plaster, provided these islands are clearly
within the boundary of the United States, and can be obtained
without any considerable expense.</p>

<p>A commission, authorizing you to hold these treaties, will be
forwarded to you in a few days.</p>

<p>As it is desirable to know by what title the people at Green
Bay and Prairie du Chien hold their lands, and whether or not
the Indian titles to those lands were extinguished by the French,
at any period subsequent to their possession of the country
(which is the impression of this Department), you will communicate
such information as you possess, or may obtain, during your
tour, on this subject.</p>

<p>In addition to Mr. Schoolcraft, Captain Douglass, of the engineer
corps, has been ordered to join you, and Mr. Whitney (in
whose behalf application has been made for that purpose) may
accompany you, if you can accommodate him. Should he accompany
you, he will be allowed the same compensation made to Mr.
Schoolcraft, who will be allowed one dollar and fifty cents a day
for the time actually employed.</p>

<p>Major-General Macomb, commandant of the 5th military department,
will, without delay, concentrate at Detroit the 5th regiment
of Infantry, excepting the recruits otherwise directed by
the general order herewith transmitted. As soon as the navigation
of the Lakes will admit, he will cause the regiment to be
transported to Fort Howard; from thence, by the way of the Fox
and Wisconsin Rivers, to Prairie du Chien, and, after detaching
a sufficient number of companies to garrison Forts Crawford and
Armstrong, the remainder will proceed to the mouth of the River
St. Peter's, where they will establish a post, at which the head-quarters
of the regiment will be located. The regiment, previous
to its departure, will receive the necessary supplies of clothing,
provisions, arms, and ammunition. Immediate application will be
made to Brigadier-General Jesup, Quartermaster-General, for funds
necessary to execute the movements required by this order.</p>

<p>The season having now arrived when the lakes may be navigated

of Major Marston's and Captain Fowle's companies, under the
command of Major Muhlenburg, will proceed to Green Bay. Surgeon's
mate R. M. Byrne, of the 5th regiment, will accompany
the detachment. The assistant deputy quartermaster-general
will furnish the necessary transport, and will send by the same
opportunity two hundred barrels of provisions, which he will draw
from the contractor at this post. The provisions must be examined
and inspected, and properly put up for transportation.
Colonel Leavenworth will, without delay, prepare his regiment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
move to the posts on the Mississippi, agreeably to the Division
order of the 10th of February. The assistant deputy quartermaster-general
will furnish the necessary transportation, to be
ready by the first of May next. The Colonel will make requisition
for such stores, ammunition, tools, and implements as may
be required, and he be able to take with him on the expedition.
Particular instructions will be given to the Colonel, explaining
the objects of his expedition.</p>

<p>Mr. Melvin Dorr is appointed Inspector of Provisions, and he
will inspect all provisions intended for the use of the army, before
they are received and issued. Lieutenant Brooks, of the 3d
regiment will forward, by the first detachment, such recruits as
he has for the companies of the 3d regiment at Mackinac.</p>

<h2>NARRATIVE OF THE EXPEDITION.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Departure&mdash;Considerations on visiting the northern summits early in the season&mdash;Cross
the Highlands of the Hudson&mdash;Incidents of the journey from Albany to
Buffalo&mdash;Visit Niagara Falls&mdash;Their grandeur the effect of magnitude&mdash;Embark

<p>The determination to penetrate to the source of the Mississippi,
during the summer months, made an early departure important.
I had, while at Potosi, in Missouri, during the prior month of
February, written to Hon. J. B. Thomas, U. S. S., Washington, to
endeavor to secure an appointment to explore the mineralogy and
natural features of the upper Mississippi River; and as soon as I
had published my treatise on the mines and minerals of Missouri,
I proceeded to Washington, and submitted to the proper officers
of the Government, my account of the mineralogical wealth of the
western domains, with a plan for the management of the public
mines. Mr. Calhoun decidedly favored these views; but, foreseeing
the necessity of congressional action on the subject, and the
necessary delays of departmental references, said to me, that he
had just received a memoir from Governor Cass, of Michigan,
proposing an expedition to the source of the Mississippi, to leave
Detroit early in the spring, and offered me the position of mineralogist
and geologist on that service. This agreeing, as it did,
with my prior views of exploring the public domains, I gladly
accepted, and immediately returned to the city of New York to
prepare for the journey.</p>

<p>The year 1820 had commenced with severe weather, the Hudson
being frozen hard, as high as West Point, on the 1st of January;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and there was a fall of snow between the 10th and 11th of February,
which laid four feet deep in the streets of New York.
March opened with mildness, and every appearance denoted an
early spring, which led me to hasten my movement north. I left
New York on the 5th of March, in the citizens' post-coach, on
sleighs, for Albany, taking the route through Westchester, and
over the Highlands of Putnam and Dutchess; sleeping at Fishkill
and Kinderhook, the first and second nights, and reaching Albany
on the morning of the 7th, a distance of one hundred and
sixty miles. This distance we made in forty hours actual travelling,
averaging four miles per hour, incidental stops included,
which is about the rate of travelling by the trekschuits of Holland,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[6]</a>
and by sledges over the frozen grounds of Russia.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[7]</a> In crossing
the Highlands, some one, in the change of the stage-sleighs,
pilfered a small box of choice minerals which I set store by; the
thief thinking, probably, from the weight and looks of the box,
which had been a banker's, that it was still filled with coin. We
crossed the Hudson from Greenbush, in a boat drawn through a
channel cut in the ice. Snow still laid in the streets of Albany,
and a cold north wind presaged a change of temperature. Next
day there was a hail-storm from the northwest, with rain and sleet,
and on the morning of the 9th, the hail lay six inches deep in
the streets. In the evening, proceeded by stage to the city of
Schenectady, a distance of sixteen miles, across the arenaceous
tract of the Pine Plains, by a turnpike, which forms the shorter
line of a triangle, made by the junction of the Mohawk with the
Hudson River. This tract is bounded southerly by the blue
summits of the Helderberg, a prominent spur of the Catskill
Mountain. At Schenectady, we experienced a night of severe
cold, and the next day, at an early hour, I took a seat in the stage-sleigh
for Utica, which we reached at seven in the evening. The
distance is ninety-six miles, which we passed in seventeen hours,
going an average rate of five miles per hour. The road lies up
the valley of the Mohawk, a name which recalls the history of
one of the most celebrated members of the Iroquois, a confederacy
of bold and indomitable tribes, who, at an early day, either pushed
their conquests or carried the terror of their arms from the St.
Lawrence to the Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The winter was still unbroken, and the weather had assumed
so unpropitious an aspect, since leaving New York, that there
was no probability of the navigation of the lakes being open so
as to embark at Buffalo before May. I proceeded seventeen miles
west to my father's residence, in the village of Vernon, to await
the development of milder weather. On the 10th of April, I resumed
my journey, taking the western stage, which had left Utica
at two o'clock in the morning. We lodged the first night at
Skeneateles, at the foot of the beautiful and sylvan lake of the
same name, and reached Geneva the next day, at one o'clock in
the afternoon. The roads were now dry and dusty; indeed, the last
traces of snow had been seen in sheltered positions, in passing
through Oneida County, and every appearance in the Ontario
country indicated a season ten days more advanced than the valley
of the Mohawk. The field poplar put forth leaves on the 18th,
and apricots were in bloom on the 22d.</p>

<p>At Geneva I remained until the 28th of April, when I again
took my seat in the mail-stage, passing, in the course of the
day, the lower margin of Canandaigua Lake, and through the
attractive and tastefully laid-out village of the same name, and,
after continuing the route through a most fertile country, with a
constantly expanding vegetation, reached Avon, on the banks of
the Genesee River. Here we slept. The next morning (the 29th),
we crossed this noble stream, and, after a long and fatiguing day's
staging, reached Buffalo in the evening. I was now at an estimated
distance of two hundred and ten miles west of Utica, and three
hundred and twenty-two from Albany. We had found the peach
and apple-tree in blossom, and the vegetation generally in an
advanced state, until reaching within eight or ten miles of Lake
Erie, where the force of the winds, and the bodies of floating ice,
evidently had the effect to retard vegetation. No vessel had yet
ventured from the harbor, and although the steamer Walk-in-the-Water
was advertised for the 1st of May, it was determined to delay
her sailing until the 6th. This gave me time to visit Niagara<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[8]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Falls, and some other places of historical interest in the neighborhood.
This object I executed immediately, taking a horse and
buggy, and keeping down the American shore. The distance is
twenty-two miles, in which the Tonewanda River is crossed by a
bridge. The day was clear and warm, with a light breeze blowing
down the river. I stopped several times to listen for the
sound of the Falls, but at the distance of fifteen, ten, eight, and
even five miles, could not distinguish any; the course of the
wind being, indeed, adverse to the transmission of sound, in that
direction, until reaching within some two or three miles. There
is nothing in the character of the country, in the approach from
Buffalo, to apprise the visitor of the difference in its level and
geological stratification, and thus prepare the mind to expect a
cataract. It is different, I afterwards learned, in the approach
from Lewiston, in which quite a mountain must first be ascended,
when views are often had of the most striking parts of the gulf,
which has been excavated by the passage of the Niagara River.
It was not easy for me to erect standards of comparison for the
eye to estimate heights. The ear is at first stunned by the incessant
roar, and the eye bewildered by the general view. I spent
two days at the place, and thus became familiarized with individual
traits of the landscape. I found the abyss at the foot of
the Falls to be the best spot for accomplishing that object. By far
the greatest disproportion in the Falls exists between the height
and great width of the falling sheet. The water is most thick and
massy at the Horseshoe Fall, which gives one the most striking
and vivid idea of creative power. In fitting positions in the gulf,
with good incidences of light, the Falls look like a mighty torrent
pouring down from the clouds. At the time of my visit, the
wind drove immense fields of ice out of Lake Erie, with floating
trees and other driftwood, but I never saw any vestiges of these
below the Falls. In front of the column of water falling on the
American side, there stood an enormous pyramid of snow, or
congealed spray.</p>

<p>What has been said by Goldsmith, and repeated by others,
respecting the destructive influence of the Rapids above to ducks
and water-fowl is imaginary&mdash;at least, as to the American sheet.
So far from it, I saw the wild ducks swim down the Rapid, as if
in pursuit of some article of food, and then rise and fly out at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
brink, and repeat the descent, as if delighted with the gift of
wings, which enabled them to sport over such frightful precipices
without danger. I found among the debris in the abyss,
pieces of hornstone, and crystals of calcareous spar, radiated
quartz, sulphuret of zinc, and sulphate of lime. Its geology is
best explained by observing that the river, in falling over the precipice
of the Niagara ridge into the basin of Lake Ontario, leaps
over horizontal strata of limestone, slate, and red sandstone. In
this respect, nothing can be more simple and plain. It is magnitude
alone that makes the cataract sublime.</p>

<p>On returning to Buffalo, I found the lake rapidly discharging
its ice, which had been recently broken up by a storm of wind;
and, while awaiting the motion of the steamer, I was joined by
Captain D. B. Douglass, Professor of Engineering at West Point,
who had been appointed topographer and astronomer of the
expedition. We embarked on the 6th of May, at nine o'clock in
the morning, in the steamer Walk-in-the-Water, an elegant and
conveniently-planned vessel, with a low-pressure Fulton engine.
This boat had been put upon the lake two years before, when it
made a trip to Michilimackinac, and was, indeed, the initial boat
in the history of steam navigation on the Lakes. We embarked
at Black Rock, and it was necessary to use a tow-line, drawn by
oxen on the shore, to enable the boat to ascend the Rapids. This
Captain Rodgers, a gentlemanly man, facetiously termed his hornbreeze.
The oxen were dismissed a short distance before reaching
the mouth of Buffalo Creek, where we reached the level of
Lake Erie, five hundred and sixty feet above the tide-waters of
the Hudson River.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[9]</a>
We were favored with clear weather, and,
a part of the time, with a fair wind. The boat touched at Erie,
at the mouth of Grand River, at Cleveland, and at Portland, in
Sandusky Bay, on coming out of which we passed Cunningham
Island, and the Put-in-Bay Islands, from a harbor in which Perry
issued to achieve his memorable naval victory on the 10th of
September, 1813. Passing through another group of islands,
called the Three Sisters, we entered the mouth of the Detroit
River late on the afternoon of the 8th, just as the light became
dim and shadowy. The scale of these waters is magnificent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
We had a glimpse of the town and fort of Malden, or Amherstburg,
and of Boisblanc, and Gross Isle, which were the last objects
distinctly seen in our ascent. The boat pushed on her way,
under the guidance of good pilots, although the night was dark,
and we reached our destination, and came to, at the city of Detroit,
at twelve o'clock P. M., thus completing the passage in sixty-two
hours.</p>

<p>The next morning, an official from the Executive of the Michigan
Territory came on board with inquiries respecting Captain
Douglass and myself, and we soon found ourselves in a circle
where we were received with marked respect and attention. It
was pleasing to behold that this respect arose, in a great degree,
from the high interest which was manifested, in all classes, for
the objects of the expedition, and the influence which its exploratory
labors were expected to have on the development of the
resources and prosperity of the country at large.</p>

<p>General Cass, who was to lead the expedition, received us cordially,
and let us know that we were in season, as some days would
still elapse before the preparations could be completed, and that
the canoes in which we were to travel had not yet reached Detroit.
We were also cordially welcomed by General Macomb, commanding
the military district, Major John Biddle, commanding
officer of the fort, and by the citizens generally. I was now, by
the computations, about seven hundred and fifty miles from my
starting-point at New York. We took up our lodgings at the
old stone house occupied by Major Whipple, which, from its
prominent position on the banks of the river, had sustained a
random cannonade during the late war. We were here introduced
to Dr. Alexander Wolcot, who filled the post of physician to the
expedition, and to Lieutenant Eneas Mackey, United States artillery,
commanding the escort, Major Robert A. Forsyth, private
secretary of the Executive, and commissary of the expedition, and
superintendent of embarkation; and to James D. Doty and Charles
C. Trowbridge, Esqs., who occupied, respectively, the situations
of official secretary and assistant topographer.</p>

<p>Detroit, the point to which I have now been conducted, is
eligibly situated on the south bank of the straits of the same
name, and enjoys the advantage of a regular plan and spacious
streets, which have been introduced since the burning of the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
French town in 1805, not a building of which, within the walls,
was saved. Its main street, Jefferson Avenue, is elevated about
forty feet above the river. The town consists of about two hundred
and fifty houses of all descriptions, public and private, and
has a population of fourteen hundred and fifty,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[10]</a> exclusive of the
garrison.</p>

<p>To the historian it is a point of great interest. It was the site
of an Indian village called Teuchsagondie in 1620, the date of the
landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth. Quebec was founded in
1608; Albany in 1614. But no regular settlement or occupancy
took place here, till the close of the seventeenth century. In
June, 1687, the French took formal possession of the straits by
erecting the arms of France. On the 24th of July, 1701, M.
Cadillac established the first military post. Charlevoix, who
landed here in 1721, found it the site of Fort Pontchartrain.</p>

<p>In 1763 the garrison, being then under British colors, sustained
a notable siege from the confederate Indians under Pontiac. It
remained under English rule till the close of the American Revolution,
and was not finally surrendered to the United States until
1790, the year following Wayne's treaty at Greenville. Surrendered
by Hull in 1812, it was reoccupied by General Harrison in October,
1813. It received a city charter 24th October, 1815. Indeed,
the prominent civil and military events of which Detroit has been
the theatre, confer on it a just celebrity, and it is gratifying to
behold that to these events it adds the charm of a beautiful local
site and fertile surrounding country. A cursory view of the map
of the United States, will indicate its importance as a central
military and commercial position. Situated on the great chain
of lakes, connecting with the waters of the Ohio, Mississippi, St.
Lawrence, Hudson, and Red River of the North, and communicating
with the Atlantic at so many points, and with a harbor
free of entrance at all times, its business capacities and means of
expansion are very great. And when the natural channels of communication
of the great lake chain shall be improved, it will
afford a choice of markets between the most distant points of
the Atlantic seaboard. It is thus destined to be to the regions
of the northwest, what St. Louis is rapidly becoming to the southwest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the seat of its commerce, the repository of its wealth, and

<p>From the moment of our arrival at Detroit, we devoted ourselves,
with intensity, to the preparation necessary for entering
the wilderness. We were to travel, from this point, by a new
mode of conveyance, namely, the Indian bark canoe, called a
chimaun, a vehicle not less novel than curious. Constructed of
large and thick sheets of the rind of the betula papyracea, or
northern birch, which are cut in garment-like folds, and sewed
together with the thin fibrous roots of the spruce, on a thin framework
of cedar ribs, and having gunwales, with a sheathing of the
same material, interposed between the bark and ribs. The seams
are carefully gummed with the pitch of the pine. The largest of
these canoes are thirty-six feet in length, and seven feet wide in
the centre, tapering to a point each way. They carry a mast and
sail, and are steered and propelled with light cedar paddles.
They are at once light, so as to be readily carried over the portages,
and so strong as to bear very considerable burdens. Those
intended for us, were ordered from the Chippewas of Lake Huron,
near Saganaw Bay. It was necessary to have mosquito-bars,
portfolios, knapsacks, and various contrivances, and to make
baggage of every sort assume the least possible bulk and space.
The public armorer had orders to furnish me suitable hammers
and other minerological apparatus for preparing and packing
specimens. The expedition was quite an event in a remote town,
and everybody seemed to take an interest in the preparation. A
fortnight passed away in these preparations, and in awaiting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
arrival of the canoes, respecting which there was some delay. It
was the 24th of May before we were ready to embark. Besides
the gentlemen mentioned as constituting the travelling party, ten
Canadian <i>voyageurs</i> were taken to manage the canoes, ten United
States soldiers to serve as an escort, and ten Ottowa, Chippewa,
and Shawnee Indians to act as hunters, under the directions of
James Riley, an Anglo-American, and Joseph Parks, a Shawnee
captive (at present, head chief of the Shawnee nation), as interpreters.
This canoe contained a chief called Kewaygooshkum, a
sedate and respectable man, who, a year afterwards, played an important
part at the treaty of Chicago.</p>

<p>The grand point of departure and leave-taking, was at Grose
Point, at the foot of Lake St. Clair, a spot nine miles distant. For
this point, horses and carriages, with the numerous friends of
Gov. Cass, pushed forward at an early hour; and there was as
much enthusiasm manifested, by all classes, as if a new world was
about to be discovered. I had a strong wish to witness the mode
of canoe travelling, and, declining an opportunity to join the cavalcade
by land, took my seat beside Major Forsyth in the Governor's
canoe. The Canadians immediately struck up one of their animating
canoe songs, the military escort at the same moment displayed
its flag and left the shore, and the auxiliary Indians, fired
with the animation of the scene, handled their paddles briskly,
and shot their canoe rapidly by us. A boat-race was the consequence.
The Indians at first kept their advantage, but the
firmer and more enduring nerves of the Canadians soon began
to tell on our speed, and as we finally passed them, the Indians
gracefully yielded the contest. We were two hours in going to
Grose Point, with the wind slightly ahead.</p>

<p>The banks of the River Detroit present continuous settlements,
in which the appearance of large old orchards and windmills,
among farm-houses and smooth cultivated fields, reminds the
visitor that the country has been long settled. And he will not
be long in observing, by the peculiarity of architecture, dress,
manners, and language, that the basis of the population is French.
We found our land party had preceded us, and as the winds were
adverse, we encamped in linen tents along the open shore. The
next day the wind increased, blowing quite a gale down the Lake.
I busied myself by making some meteorological and geological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
observations. The shores of Lake St. Clair are formed of a fertile
alluvium, resting on drift. There are some heavy boulders of
primitive rock resting on this, which denote a vast field of former
drift action around the shores of these lakes.</p>

<p>The wind abated about eleven o'clock on the morning of the
26th, when the men commenced loading the canoes. It was
twelve before we embarked. The mode of their embarkation is
peculiar. The canoes, when laden, are hauled out in deep water;
the men then catch up the sitters on their backs, and deposit them
in their respective seats; when this was done, they struck up one
of their animated songs, and we glided over the smooth surface
of the lake with rapidity, holding our course parallel with its
shores, generally, until reaching a prominent point of land near
Huron River.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[12]</a></p>

<p>From Point Huron we crossed the lake, to reach the central mouth
of the St. Clair River, thereby saving a tedious circuit; by the time
we had half accomplished the transit, we encountered a head wind,
which put the strength of the men severely to the test, and retarded
our reaching the mouth of the river till dark. The River
St. Clair has several mouths, which branch off above through a
broad delta, creating large islands. These channels discharge a
vast amount of argillaceous drift and mud, which has so far filled
up the lake itself, that there is anchorage, I believe, in every part
of it; and the principal ship channel is scooped, by the force of
the current, out of a very compact blue clay&mdash;the geological residuum
of ancient formations of clay-slates in the upper country.</p>

<p>The shores are often but a few inches <i>above</i>, and often a few
inches <i>below</i>the surface, where they give origin to a growth of
reeds, flags, and other aquatic plants, which remind the traveller
of similar productions at the Balize of the Mississippi. In this
nilotic region, myriads of water-fowls find a favorite resort. To
us, however, these jets of alluvial formation, bearing high grass
and rushes were as so many friendly arms stretched out to shelter
us from the wind; but they were found to be so low and wet, that
we were compelled to urge our way through them, in search of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>dry encampment, till within two hours of midnight. This brought
us to the upper end of Lawson's Island, where we arrived, wet,
weary, and cold. We had advanced about twenty-five miles, having
been ten hours, in a cramped posture, in our canoes. This initial
day's journey was calculated to take away the poetry of travel
from the amateurs of our party, and to let us all know, that there
were toils in our way that required to be conquered.</p>

<p>We slept little this night, and waited for daylight and sunrise,
as if the blessed luminary would have an animating effect upon
our actual condition. We again embarked at seven o'clock in
the morning. We now stowed away things with more handiness
than at the first embarkation, and we began, ourselves, to feel a
little more at home in this species of voyaging.</p>

<p>We had three canoes in our little squadron provided with
masts and sails, and a small United States pennant to each, so
that the brigade, when in motion, and led, as it usually was, by
the chanting canoemen, had a formidable and animated appearance.</p>

<p>The River St. Clair is a broad and noble stream, and impressed
us as justifying the highest encomiums bestowed on it by Charlevoix,
La Hontan, and other early French travellers. We ascended
it thirty miles, which brought us to Fort Gratiot, at the foot of
the rapid which marks the outlet of Lake Huron. In this distance,
we passed, at separate places, nine vessels at anchor, being
detained by head winds, and encountered several Chippewa and
Ottowa canoes, each of which were generally occupied by a single
family, with their females, blankets, guns, fishing apparatus, and
dogs. They evinced the most friendly disposition.</p>

<p>In landing at Oak Point,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[13]</a> I observed a green snake (coluber
æstivus) in the act of swallowing a frog, which he had succeeded
in taking down, except the extremity of its hind legs. A blow
was sufficient to relieve the frog, which still had sufficient animation
to hop towards the river. The snake I made to pay the forfeit
of his life.</p>

<p>At Fort Gratiot, we were received by Major Cummins, U. S. A.,
who occupied the post with sixty men. The expedition was received
with a salute, which is due to the Governor of a Territory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Two soldiers who were sickly, were here returned, and five able-bodied
men received to supply their places, thus increasing the
aggregate of the party to forty persons.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[14]</a></p>

<p>The banks of the River St. Clair are wholly alluvial or diluvial.
There is not a particle of rock in place. One idea presses itself
prominently to notice, in reflecting on the formation of the country.
It is the vast quantum of clay, mixed drift, and boulders, which
have evidently been propelled, by ancient forces, down these
straits, and afterwards arranged themselves according to affinities,
or gravitation. At the precipitous banks between the inlet of
Black River and Fort Gratiot, this action has been so clearly
within the erratic block period of De la Buck, that it has imbedded
prostrate forest-trees, and even freshwater shells, beneath the
heavy stratum of sand, resting immediately upon the fundamental
clay beds, upon which the city of Detroit, and indeed the alluvions
of the entire straits rest.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[15]</a> We again encountered at this place,
blocks of the primitive or crystalline boulders, which were first
seen at Grosse Point. There are some traces of iron sand along
the shore of this river, the only mineral body, indeed, which has
thus rewarded my examinations.</p>

<p>We left our encampment, at Fort Gratiot, at eight o'clock next
morning. A strong and deep rapid is immediately encountered,
up which, however, vessels having a good wind find no difficulty
in making their way. On surmounting this, we found ourselves
on the level of Lake Huron. The lake here bursts upon the
view in one of those magnificent landscapes which are peculiar
to this region. Nature has everywhere operated on the grandest
scale. Wide ocean expanses and long lines of shore spread
before the eye, which gazes admiringly on the broad and often
brilliant horizon, and then turns, for something to rest on, along
the shore. Long ridges of gravel, sand, and boulders, meet it
here. Beyond and above this storm-battered beach, are fringes
of woods, or banks of clay. The monotony of travelling by unvaried
scenes is relieved by an occasional song of the boatmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>or an occasional landing&mdash;by changes of forest-trees&mdash;of the wind,
or flights of the gull, duck, plover, and other birds; but the traveller,
is apt, before evening comes, to fancy himself very much in
the position of a piece of merchandise which is transported from
place to place. Glad were we when night approached, and the
order to encamp was heard. It was estimated we had advanced
thirty-five miles.</p>

<p>On passing along the Huron coast about fifteen miles, a bank
of dark clay is encountered, which has an elevation of thirty or
forty feet, and extends six or eight miles. We soon after came
to the White Rock&mdash;an enormous detached mass, or boulder of
transition,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[16]</a> or semi-crystalline limestone. It is a noted landmark
for <i>voyageurs</i> and travellers, and an equally celebrated place of
offerings by the Indians. I requested to be landed on it, and
detached some specimens. Geologically, it is a member of the
erratic block group, and we must look for its parent bed at a
more westerly point. There is no formation of limestone, in this
quarter, to which it can be referred. It bears marks of attrition,
which shows that it has been rubbed against other hard bodies;
and if transported down the lake on ice, it is necessary to consider
these marks as pre-existing at the era of its removal.</p>

<p>On embarking in the morning, the wind was slightly ahead,
which continued during the forenoon, changing in the after-part
of the day, so that we were able to hoist sail. About four o'clock
the weather became cloudy and hazy, the wind increasing, at
the same time attended with thunder and lightning. A storm
was rapidly gathering, and the lake became so much agitated
that we immediately effected a landing, which was not done without
some difficulty, on a shallow and dangerous shore, thickly
strewn with boulders. We pitched our tents on a small peninsula,
or narrow neck of land, covered with beautiful forest-trees,
which was nearly separated from the main shore. Shortly after
our arrival a vessel hove in sight, and anchored on the same
dangerous lee shore. We were in momently expectation of her
being driven from her moorings, but were happily relieved, the
next morning, to observe that she had rode out the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
The lake was still too rough on the following day, and the
wind too high, to permit our embarking. We made an excursion
inland. The country proved low, undulatory, and swampy. The
forest consisted of hemlock, birch, ash, oak, and maple, with
several species of mosses, which gave it a cold, bleak character.
The margin of the forest was skirted with the bulrush, briza
canadensis, and other aquatic plants. The whole day passed, a
night, and another day, with nothing but the loud sounding lake
roar in our ears. A heavy bed of the erratic block formation
commences at this point, and continues to Point aux Barques,
the eastern cape of Saganaw Bay.</p>

<p>In one of these displaced masses&mdash;a boulder of mica slate, I
discovered well-defined crystals of staurotide. This formed my
second mineralogical acquisition.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[17]</a> There were, also, some
striking water-worn masses of granitical and hornblende porphyry.</p>

<p>It was the 1st of June before we could leave the spot where
we had been confined. We embarked at six o'clock, the lake
being sufficiently pacific, though not yet settled. But after proceeding
about a league, it again became agitated, and drove us
ashore, where we lay without encamping. Kewaygushkum was
requested to send some of his young men in quest of game.
The soldiers and engagees also formed fishing parties, at a contiguous
river; but about three o'clock in the afternoon all the
parties returned completely unsuccessful. There was neither
fish nor game to be had. At the same time the agitation of the
lake ceased, the wind springing up from an opposite quarter,
which enabled us to hoist sail. This put every one in a pleasant
humor, and we proceeded along the coast till evening, and
encamped on a small sandy bay, which puts into the land, immediately
beyond the promontory of Point aux Barques&mdash;an
estimated distance of twenty-five miles from our starting-point in
the morning.</p>

<p>At the distance of a league before reaching this point, the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
stratum of rock, <i>in situ</i>, presents itself. It is a gray friable sandstone,
elevated from ten to twenty feet above the water, but
attaining a greater height in the approach to this noted cape.
This stratum of sandstone rock, which is of a perishable character,
is exposed to receive the shock of the waves of Lake
Huron for several hundred miles from the north and west. It
exhibits the force and fury of the lake action by the numerous
cavities which have been worn into it, at the water's edge, and
by the sub-bays which have, in some localities, been formed in
the line of dark opposing cliffs. It was in one of these sub-bays
that we encamped, on a smooth sandy beach, which appears to
have been a favorite encamping ground of the natives. But although
we had met several canoes of Chippewas, on the route
between Fort Gratiot and this point, none were found at the
place of our encampment. Such of them as we approached, on
the lake, were invariably in want of food, and received it with
evident marks of gratification.</p>

<p>On going inland, back from our encampment, we found a succession
of arid ridges of sand, which had been evidently produced
by the prostrated sandstone of the coast, which, after comminution
by the waves, had been carried to this position by the winds.
These ancient dunes and ridges were covered sparsely with pitch
pines and aspen, and having their surfaces covered with the uva
ursi, pyrola, and smaller shrub-growth common to arenaceous
soils.</p>

<p>On the day following, we ascended along the eastern shores of
Saganaw Bay, a distance of eighteen miles, which brought us
to Point aux Chenes. At this place the guides pointed to a group
of islands about midway of the bay, for which we steered. The
calmness of the weather favored the traverse. We reached and
landed on the largest of the group, called Shawangunk, by the
Indians, probably from its southernmost position. I found it to
consist of a dark, compact limestone, imbedding masses of chalcedony
and calcareous spar. I also picked up a detached mass
of argillaceous oxide of iron, and some fragments of striped
hornstone. Anxious to improve the favorable time for effecting
the passage, we pushed on for the opposite western shore, which
was safely reached. We then steered down the bay, skirting a
low sandy shore some twenty miles or more, till entering the
open lake, and reaching the River aux Sables. On entering this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
river, and after having pitched our camp, we were visited by a
band of Chippewa Indians, with friendly salutations. It appeared
that the arrival of the expedition had been anticipated by them,
they having themselves constructed and furnished the canoes for
it, and being well acquainted with the official position, at Detroit,
of the leader of our party. The principal Chief, the Black Eagle,
addressed a speech to Governor Cass, in which he appropriately
recognized these relations, welcomed him to his village, and recommended
the condition of his people to his notice. The
calumet was then smoked in the usual style of Indian ceremony,
the pipe-bearer beginning with persons of first rank, and handing
it in the supposed order of grade, to the lowest member of the
official family. The ceremony was ended by shaking of hands.
All this was done with the ease and dignity of an oriental sheikh.
We had anticipated savages, and savage manners, and armed ourselves
to the teeth, pushing a point with an army official at
Detroit, until we were each provided with a short rifle. But this
first formal council with the sons of the forest, began to open
our eyes to the true character of the Indian manners and diplomacy,
in their intercourse with government officials.</p>

<p>The chiefs, after their departure, sent to our encampment a
present of fresh sturgeon, a species which is caught abundantly
in the aux Sables at this time, for which returns were made of
such articles as were most acceptable to them. Being out of
the Bay, we employed the following day making advances along
the Huron coast, an estimated distance of forty-eight miles. In
this distance, we passed Thunder Bay. Encamped on a low, calcareous
shore, bearing cedar and spruce, which the Indians call
Sho-she-ko-naw-be-ko-king, or Flat Rock Point. A few miles
after leaving River aux Sables, the Highlands of Sables present
themselves at a short distance back from the shore. This ridge,
which is a landmark for mariners, runs from southeast to northwest,
and is visible as far as Thunder Bay. The limestone, which
is dark and of an earthy fracture, is very much broken up on the
shore, and contains various species of organic remains. On crossing
the Bay, we landed on an island covered with debris, where
we observed one of those imitative, water-worn, primitive boulders,
resembling altars, which are frequently set up by the Indians as
the places of depositing some offering, or out of mere respect for
some local god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
At six o'clock the next morning we were again in our canoes,
assiduously moving along the Huron coast; but, after proceeding
about a league, a storm of wind and rain suddenly arose, driving
us from the lake. A few hours served to restore its calmness,
but we had not gone over a couple of leagues when we were
again compelled by the rising wind to take to the shore, where
we were detained the rest of the day, listening to the capricious
murmurs of the lake. This position was directly opposite Middle
Island, a noted anchorage about six miles distant. All night the
waves of the lake were heard. The morning broke without
change. Lake Huron still evinced an angry aspect, threatening
to renew the struggle of yesterday. It was concluded to send the
canoes forward, relieved of our weight, and proceed ourselves on
foot along the beach. Walking on this became difficult on those
parts of it where the fossiliferous and shelly limestone had been
broken up and heaped in small fragments. Among these, we
recognized specimens of the cornu-ammonis, and the maderpore,
with some other species. The cedars and brushy growth generally
stood so thick, and grew so closely to this line of debris,
that it was impracticable to take the woods. The toil, however,
rewarded us with some specimens of the organic forms imbedded
in the rock, while it enabled the topographers to secure the data
for a very perfect map of the coast. At ten o'clock in the morning
we reached the east cape of Presque Isle Bay, where the
canoes came to take us across to the peninsula of that name.
After completing this, the men landed the canoes and baggage on
the peninsula side, and carried them across the narrow sandy neck
of land; but, on reaching the open lake beyond it, the wind was
found too strongly adverse to permit embarkation. The Canadians
have the not inappropriate term of <i>degrade</i> for this species
of detention; we were here foiled, indeed, in our high hopes of
pushing ahead, and compelled to wait on the naked sands for
many weary hours. While thus detained, the Indians brought
in a brown rabbit,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[18]</a> a species of lake tortoise, and some pigeons,
being their only fruits of success in hunting, except a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>grouse, or partridge, which had crowned their efforts since leaving
Detroit. It must be borne in mind, however, that there has
been very little opportunity for hunting, that we have had
abundant supplies, and that our mode of travelling is such as to
alarm all game within sound of our track. They have, indeed,
brought reports at several points of seeing the footprints of the
deer and black bear, but they have not had the leisure to pursue
them.</p>

<p>At five o'clock, the wind abated so much as to permit embarkation,
and our canoemen hastened forward with the intention of
travelling all night, but at eleven o'clock it freshened to such a
degree, and at the same time became so intensely dark, that we
were compelled to land and encamp. Neither the topography,
mineralogy, or any branch of the physical geography of a country
can be ascertained without minute examination; and this constitutes,
indeed, the object of the investigations, which have been,
thus far, so toilsomely pursued against adverse winds since the
commencement of the expedition; but they have disclosed facts
which reveal the true structure and physical history of this bleak,
ungenial coast; this hope serves, every day, to give new impetus
to the voyage.</p>

<p>Another day along the Huron coast. It was now the 6th of
June. The <i>voyageurs</i> began now to manifest great anxiety to
reach Michilimackinac, and had their canoes in the water at a
very early hour. We all participated in this feeling, and saw with
pleasure the long lines of sandy shores, strewed with boulders and
pebbles, that were swiftly passed. We had traced about forty
miles of the coast when we reached the foot of Bois Blanc Island,
and pushed over the intervening arm of the lake to get its south
or lee shore. This was a labor of hazard, as the wind was directly
ahead, and drove the waves into the canoes. When accomplished,
we had the shelter of this island for twelve miles, till
reaching its southwest part. We then passed, due north, between
it and Isle Ronde, which brought the wind again ahead.
But the men had not kept this course long, when Michilimackinac,
with its picturesque and imposing features, burst upon our view.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Nothing can present a more refreshing and inspiring landscape.
From that moment the <i>voyageurs</i> appeared to disregard the wind.
Striking into the water with bolder paddles, and opening one of
their animating boat-songs, all thought of past toils was forgotten,
and, urged forward with a new impetus, we entered the handsome
little crescent-shaped harbor at four o'clock. The expedition
was received with a salute from the fort, in command of Capt. B. K.
Pierce, U. S. A.,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[19]</a> in compliment to the Governor of the Territory,
and we landed amid the congratulations of the citizens, who
pressed forward to welcome us.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the first part of our journey, after a tedious
voyage of fourteen days, in which we had encountered a series
of almost continued head-winds and foul weather. The distance by
ship is usually estimated at three hundred miles; by following the
indentations of the coast, and entering Saganaw Bay, we found it
three hundred and sixty.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[20]</a> We found the Huron coast, to the
line of which our observations were limited, bearing, in its vegetation,
indubitable marks of its exposure to the northern winds.
As a section of the lake geology, it is simple and instructive, exhibiting
strata of sandstone and non-crystalline and fossiliferous
limestone in horizontal positions, without the slightest disturbance
in their dip or inclinations. Its mineralogy is scanty, being
nearly confined, so far as observed, to some common silicious
minerals, and traces of argillaceous and magnetic oxides of iron.
The erratic block-stratum or drift, is remarkable, and prepares
the mind for the still heavier accumulations of this kind which
are perceived to be spread over the northern latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[21]</a></p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the beauty of this island. It is a mass of
calcareous rock, rising from the bed of Lake Huron, and reaching
an elevation of more than three hundred feet above the water.
The waters around are purity itself. Some of its cliffs shoot up
perpendicularly, and tower in pinnacles like ruinous Gothic
steeples. It is cavernous in some places; and in these caverns,
the ancient Indians, like those of India, have placed their dead.
Portions of the beach are level, and adapted to landing from
boats and canoes. The harbor, at its south end, is a little gem.
Vessels anchor in it, and find good holding. The little old-fashioned
French town nestles around it in a very primitive
style. The fort frowns above it, like another Alhambra, its
white walls gleaming in the sun. The whole area of the island
is one labyrinth of curious little glens and valleys. Old green
fields appear, in some spots, which have been formerly cultivated
by the Indians. In some of these there are circles of
gathered-up stones, as if the Druids themselves had dwelt here.
The soil, though rough, is fertile, being the comminuted materials
of broken-down limestones. The island was formerly covered
with a dense growth of rock-maples, oaks, ironwood, and other
hard-wood species, and there are still parts of this ancient forest
left, but all the southern limits of it exhibit a young growth.
There are walks and winding paths among its little hills, and precipices
of the most romantic character. And whenever the visitor
gets on eminences overlooking the lake, he is transported with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sublime views of a most illimitable and magnificent water prospect.
If the poetic muses are ever to have a new Parnassus in
America, they should inevitably fix on Michilimackinac. Hygeia,
too, should place her temple here, for it has one of the purest,
driest, clearest, and most healthful atmospheres.</p>

<p>We remained encamped upon this lovely island six days, while
awaiting the arrival of supplies and provisions for the journey,
or their being prepared for transportation by hand over the
northern portages. Meats, bread, Indian corn, and flour, had to
be put in kegs, or stout linen bags.</p>

<p>The traders and old citizens said so much about the difficulties
and toils of these northern portages that we did not know but
what we, ourselves, were to be put in bags; but we escaped that
process. This delay gave us the opportunity of more closely
examining the island. It is about three and a half miles long, two
in its greatest width, and nine in circumference. The site of Fort
Holmes, the apex, is three hundred and twelve feet above the
lake. The eastern margin consists of precipitous cliffs, which,
in many places, overhang the water, and furnish a picturesque
rocky-fringe, as it were, to the elevated plain. The whole rock
formation is calcareous. It exhibits the effects of a powerful diluvial
action at early periods, as well as the continued influence
of elemental action, still at work. Large portions of the cliffs
have been precipitated upon the beach, where the process of degradation
has been carried on by the waves. A most striking
instance of such precipitations is to be witnessed at the eastern
cliff, called Robinson's Folly, which fell, by its own gravitation,
within the period of tradition. The formation, at this point, formerly
overhung the beach, commanding a fine view of the lake
and islands in all directions, in consequence of which it was occupied
with a summer-house, by the officers of the British garrison,
after the abandonment of the old peninsular fort, about 1780.</p>

<p>The mineralogical features of the island are not without interest.
I examined the large fragments of debris, which are still
prominent, and which exhibit comparatively fresh fractures.
The rock contains a portion of sparry matter, which is arranged
in reticulæ, filled with white carbonate of lime, in such a state
of loose disintegration that the weather soon converts it to the
condition of agaric mineral. These reticulæ are commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in the slate of calcspar, crystallized in minute crystals. The stratum
on which this loose formation rests is compact and firm,
and agrees in structure with the encrinal limestone of Drummond
Island and the Manitouline chain. But the vesicular stratum,
which may be one hundred and ten or twenty feet thick, has been
deposited in such a condition that it has not had, in some localities,
firmness enough permanently to sustain itself. The consequence
is, that the table-land has caved in, and exhibits singular
depressions, or grass-covered, cup-shaped cavities, which have no
visible outlet for the rain-water that falls in them, unless it percolates
through the shelly strata. Portions of it, subject to this
structure, have been pressed off during changing seasons, by
frosts, and carried away by rains, creating that castellated appearance
of pinnacles, which gives so much peculiarity to the rocky
outlines of the island.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">ARCHED ROCK</span> is an isolated mass of self-sustaining rock,
on the eastern facade of cliffs; it offers one of those coincidences of
geological degradation in which the firmer texture of the silicious
and calcareous portions of it have, thus far, resisted decomposition.
Its explanation, is, however, simple: The apex of this
geological monument is on a level, or nearly so, with the Fort
Holmes summit. While the diluvial action, of which the whole
island gives striking proofs, carried away the rest of the reticulated
or magnesian limestone, this singular point, having a firmer
texture, resisted its power, and remains to tell the visitor who
gazes at it, that waters have once held dominion over the highest
part of the island.</p>

<p>Before dismissing the subject of the geological phenomena of
this island, it may be observed that it is covered with the erratic
block or drift stratum. Primitive or crystalline pebbles and
boulders are found, but not plentifully, on the surface. They are
observed, however, on the highest summit, and upon the lower
plain; one of the best localities of these boulders, exists on the
depressed ground, leading north, in the approach to Dousman's
Farm, where there is a remarkable accumulation of blocks of
granite and hornblende drift boulders. The principal drift of the
island consists of smooth, small, calcareous pebbles, and, at deeper
positions, angular fragments of limestone. Sandstone boulders
are not rare. Over the plain leading from the fort north by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
way of the Skull Rock, are spread extensive beds of finely comminuted
calcareous gravel, the particles of which often not exceeding
the size of a buck-shot, which makes one of the most
solid and compact natural macadamized roads of which it is
possible to conceive. Carriage wheels on it run as smoothly,
but far more solid, than they could over a plank floor. This
formation appears to be the diluvial residuum or ultimate wash,
which arranged itself agreeably to the laws of its own gravitation,
on the recession of the watery element, to which its comminution
is clearly due. It would be worth transportation, in boxes, for
gravelling ornamental garden-walks. The soil of the island is
highly charged with the calcareous element, and, however barren
in appearance, is favorable to vegetation. Potatoes have been
known to be raised in pure beds of small limestone pebbles,
where the seed potatoes had been merely covered in a slight way,
to shield them from the sun, until they had taken root.</p>

<p>The historical reminiscences connected with this island are of
an interesting character. It appears from concurrent testimony,
that the old town on the peninsula was settled about 1671,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[22]</a> which
was seven years before the building of Fort Niagara. In that
year, Father Marquette, a French missionary, prevailed on a party
of Hurons to locate themselves at that spot, and it was therefore
the first point of settlement made northwest of Fort Frontenac, on
Lake Ontario. It was probably first garrisoned by La Salle, in
1678, and continued to be the seat of the fur trade, and in many
respects, the metropolis of the extreme northwest, during the
whole period of French domination in the Canadas. After the
fall of Quebec, in 1759, it passed by treaty to the British government,
but much against the wishes of the Indian tribes, who
retained a strong partiality for their early friends, the French.
Pontiac arose at this time, to dispute the English authority in the
northwest, and with confederates projected a series of bold
attacks upon the forts extending from the Ohio to this post.
Most of these were successful, but he was defeated at Detroit,
where he commanded in person, after a series of extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>movements. While he was pressing the siege of the garrison, he
enjoined neutrality upon the French inhabitants, who were nevertheless
called on to furnish cattle and corn for the subsistence of
his warriors. It is remarked on good authority that, for these
supplies, he issued evidences of debt. When General Bradstreet
marched to the relief of the fort, with an army of three thousand
men, the spirit and laconic temper of the warrior were at the
same time evinced. He sent a deputation of chiefs to meet the
herald of the British general, at Maumee, with the laconic and
symbolic message: "I stand in the path."</p>

<p>The execution of the plan of attack on Old Fort Mackinac appears
to have been intrusted to Minnawanna, a Chippewa chief, who,
in addition to his own people, was aided by the Sacs. The Ottowas
afterwards expressed displeasure in not having been admitted to a
participation in the attack. The plan was ingeniously laid. The
king's birthday, the 4th of June (1763), having arrived, the Chippewas
and Sacs turned out to play, for a high wager, at ball.
Many of the garrison, and the commanding officer himself, came
out to witness the sport; and there was such a feeling of security
that the gates of the fort were left open. To put the troops
more off their guard, the ball had been thrown over the picket,
and when once there, it was natural that it should be followed by
the opposite parties, heated with the contest and eager for victory.
But this artifice was the accomplishment of the plan. The war-whoop
was immediately sounded, and an indiscriminate slaughter
commenced. A few moments of intense anxiety ensued. They were
passed by the officers eagerly listening for the roll of the drum. But
they were passed in disappointment. There was no call of this
kind to concentrate resistance. Panic and slaughter raged in
their most fearful forms. None were spared who were deemed
friendly to the English interest but such as were effectually
secreted. Some of the soldiers who escaped the first onset, were
incarcerated in a room, where they were sacrificed to glut the
vengeance of a chief, who did not arrive till the principal work
of slaughter had been accomplished.</p>

<p>This event sealed the fate of the old fort and the town on the
peninsula. The British afterwards took possession of the island,
which had served to give name to the peninsular fort. The town
was gradually removed, by pulling down the buildings, and
transporting the timber to the island, till there was not a building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or fixture left; and the site is now as silent and deserted as
if it had never been the scene of an active resident population.</p>

<p>The Island of Michilimackinac appears to have been occupied
first as a military position by the British, about 1780, say some
seven years after the massacre of the garrison of the old peninsular
fort of the same name.</p>

<p>Wherever Michilimackinac is mentioned in the missionary letters
or history of this period, it is the ancient fort, on the apex of
the Michigan peninsula, that is alluded to.</p>

<p>The present town is pleasantly situated around a little bay that
affords good clay anchorage and a protection from west and north
winds. It has a very antique and foreign look, and most of the
inhabitants are, indeed, of the Canadian type of the French. The
French language is chiefly spoken. It consists of about one
hundred and fifty houses and some four hundred and fifty permanent
inhabitants.</p>

<p>It is the seat of justice for the most northerly county of Michigan.
According to the observation of Lieut. Evelith, the island
lies in north latitude 45° 54´, which is only twenty-three minutes
north of Montreal, as stated by Prof. Silliman.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[23]</a> It is in west
longitude 7° 10´ from Washington.</p>

<p>Col. Croghan's attempt to take the island, during the late war,
was most unfortunate. He failed from a double spirit of dissension
in his own forces, being at odds with the commanding
officer of the fleet, and at sword's points with his second in command,
Major Holmes. After entering the St. Mary's, and taking
and burning the old post of St. Joseph's, where nobody resisted,
instead of sailing direct to Mackinac, a marauding expedition
was sent up this river to St. Mary's, and when the fleet and troops
finally reached Mackinac, instead of landing at the town, under
the panic of the inhabitants, it sailed about for several days. In
the mean time the island filled with Indians from the surrounding
shores.</p>

<p>Fort "Mackina" is eligibly situated on a cliff overlooking the
town and harbor, and is garrisoned by a company of artillery.
The ruin of Fort Holmes, formerly Fort George, occupies the
apex of the island, and has been dismantled since the British
evacuated it in 1815.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
It happened that the British authorities on the island of St.
Joseph, got intelligence of the declaration of war, in 1812,
through Canada, before the American commander at Mackinac
heard of it. Mustering their forces with such volunteers,
militia, and Indians as could be hastily got together, they proceeded
in boats to the back of the island, where they secretly
landed at night with some artillery, and by daylight the next
morning got the latter in place on the summit of Fort Holmes,
which completely commanded the lower fort, when they sent a
summons of surrender, which Captain Hanks, the American commanding
officer, had no option but to obey.</p>

<p>Colonel Croghan, the hero of Sandusky, attempted to regain
possession of it, in 1814, with a competent force, and after several
demonstrations of his fleet about the island, by which time was
lost and panic in the enemy allayed, he landed on the northern
part of it, which is depressed, and his army marched through
thick woods, most favorable for the operations of the Indians, to
the open grounds of Dousman's Farm, where the army was met
by Colonel McDouall, who was eligibly posted on an eminence
with but few regular troops, but a heavy force of Indian auxiliaries
and the village militia. Major Holmes, who gallantly led
the attack, swinging his sword, was killed at a critical moment,
and the troops retreated before Colonel Croghan could reach the
field with a reinforcement. Thus ended this affair.</p>

<p>My attention was directed to the plaster stated to exist on the St.
Martin Islands. These islands compose a small group lying about
nine or ten miles north-northeast of Michilimackinac. Captain
Knapp, of the revenue service, had been requested to take me to
the spot with the revenue cutter under his command. I was
accompanied by Captain Douglass, of the expedition, and by
Lieutenant John Pierce, U. S. A., stationed at the fort.</p>

<p>The gypsum exists in a moist soil, not greatly elevated, during
certain winds above the lake. Pits had been dug by persons visiting
the locality for commercial purposes. It occurs in granular lumps
of a gray color, as also in foliated and fibrous masses, white, gray,
chestnut color, or sometimes red. No difficulty was encountered
in procuring as many specimens as were required. This group
of islands is noticeable, also, for the large boulder masses of hornblende
and granite rock, which are found imbedded in, or lying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
on the surface, along with fragments of breccia, quartz, &amp;c. This
drift is more abundant, on all the islands I have seen, as we
approach the north shores of Lake Huron. Having completed
the examination of these islands, we returned to the harbor after
an agreeable excursion.</p>

<p>To observe the structure and character of the Island of Michilimackinac,
I determined to walk entirely around it, following the
beach at the foot of the cliffs. This, although a difficult task,
from brush and debris, became a practicable one, except on the
north and northwest borders, where there was, for limited spaces,
no margin of debris, at which points it became necessary to wade
in the water at the base of low precipitous rocks. In addition
to the reticulated masses of limestone covered with calcspar from
the fallen cliffs, the search disclosed small tabular pieces of minutely
crystallized quartz and angular masses of a kind of striped
hornstone, gray and lead colored, which had been liberated from
similar positions in the cliffs. On passing the west margin of the
island, I observed a bed of a species of light-blue clay, which is
stated to part with its coloring matter in baking it, becoming
white.</p>

<p>While the British possessed the island, they attempted to procure
water by digging two wells at the site of Fort George (now
Holmes), but were induced to relinquish the work without success,
at the depth of about one hundred feet. Among the fragments
of rock thrown out, are impressions of bivalve and univalve
shells, with an impression resembling the head of a trilobite.
These are generally in the condition of chalcedony, covered with
very minute crystals of quartz. I also discovered a drift specimen
of brown oxide of iron, on the north quarter. This sketch
embraces all that is important in its mineralogical character.</p>

<p>This island appears to have been occupied by the Indians,
from an early period. Human bones have been discovered at
more than one point, in the cavernous structure of the island;
but no place has been so much celebrated for disclosures of this
kind, as the <span class="smcap">Skull Cave</span>. This cave has a prominent entrance,
shaded by a few trees, and appears to have been once devoted to
the offices of a charnel-house by the Indians. It is not mentioned
at all, however, by writers, till 1763, in the month of June of
which year the fort of old Mackinac on the peninsula, was treacherously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
taken by the Sac and Chippewa Indians. An extensive
and threatening confederation of the western Indians had then
been matured, and a large body of armed warriors was then encamped
around the walls of Detroit, under the leadership of
Pontiac, who held the garrison in close siege day and night. The
surrender of Canada to Great Britain, which had followed the
victory of General Wolfe at Quebec, was distasteful to these Indians,
and they attempted the mad project of driving back beyond
the Alleghanies the English race; making a simultaneous assault
upon all the military posts west of that great line of demarcation,
and preaching and dealing out vengeance to all who had English
blood in their veins. Alexander Henry, a native of Albany,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[25]</a>
was one of those enterprising men who had pushed his fortunes
West, with an adventure of merchandise, on the first exchange of
posts, and he was singled out for destruction, as soon as the fort was
taken. He had taken refuge in the house of a Frenchman named
Longlade, where he was concealed in a garret by a Pawnee slave,
and where he hid himself under a heap of birch-bark buckets, such
as are employed in the Indian country, in the spring season, in
carrying the sap of the sugar-maple. But this temporary reprieve
from the Indian knife seemed only the prelude to a series
of hairbreadth escapes, which impressed him as the direct interposition
of Providence. At length, when the scenes of blood and
intoxication began to abate a little, an old Indian friend of his,
called Wawetum, who had once pledged his friendship, but who
had been absent during the massacre, sought him out, and having
reclaimed him by presents, in a formal council, took him into his
canoe and conducted the spared witness of these atrocities three
leagues across the waters of Lake Huron in safety to this island.</p>

<p>To this place they were accompanied by the actors in this tragedy
to the number of three hundred and fifty fighting men,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[26]</a> and
he would now, under the protection of Wawetum, have been safe
from immediate peril, but that in a few days a prize of two canoes
of merchandise in the hands of English traders was made, amongst
which was a large quantity of liquor. Hereupon, Wawetum, foreseeing
another carousal, and always fearful of his friend, requested
him to go up with him to the mountain part of the island. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
ascended it, he led him to this cave, and recommended him
to abide here in concealment until the debauch was over, when
he promised to visit him.</p>

<p>Breaking some branches at its mouth for a bed, he then sought
its recesses, and spreading his blanket around, laid down and slept
till morning. Daylight revealed to him the fact that he had
been reposing on dry human bones, and that the cave had anciently
been devoted by the Indians as a sepulchre. On announcing
this fact to his deliverer, two days afterward, when he came
to seek him, Wawetum expressed his ignorance of it, and a party
of the Indians, who came to examine it in consequence of the
announcement, also concurred in declaring that they had no tradition
on the subject. They conjectured that the bones were
either due to the period when the sea covered the earth&mdash;which
is a common belief with them&mdash;or to the period of the Huron
occupancy of this island, after that tribe were defeated by the Iroquois,
in the St. Lawrence valley.</p>

<p>So much for tradition.</p>

<p>This island has been long known as a prominent point in the
fur trade. But of this I am not prepared to speak. It was
selected by Mr. J. J. Astor, in 1816, as the central point of outfit
for his clerks and agents in this region; and the warehouses
erected for their accommodation constitute prominent features in
its modern architecture. The capital annually invested in this
business is understood to be about three hundred thousand dollars.
This trade was deemed an object of the highest consequence
from the first settlement of Canada, but it was not till 1766, agreeably
to Sir Alexander Mackenzie, that it commenced from Michilimackinac.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[27]</a>
The number of furred animals taken in a single
year, the same author states to be one hundred and eighty-two
thousand two hundred; of which number, the astonishing proportion
of one hundred and six thousand were beavers.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[28]</a> Estimating
each skin at but one pound, and the foreign market price at four
dollars per pound, which are both much below the average at this
era, this item of beaver alone would exceed by more than one-third
the whole capital employed, taking the data before mentioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and leave the seventy-six thousand smaller furred animals
to be put on the profit side. No wonder that acts of perfidy
arose between rivals, such as the shooting of Mr. Waden at his
own dinner-table, where he was entertaining an opponent or
copartner in the trade; or the foul assassination of Owen Keveny
on the Rainy Lakes.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[29]</a> Indeed, the fur trade has for a long period
been more productive, if we are to rely on statements, than the
richest silver mines of Mexico or Peru.</p>

<p>Society at Michilimackinac consists of so many diverse elements,
which impart their hue to it, that it is not easy for a passing
traveller to form any just estimate of it. The Indian, with his
plumes, and gay and easy costume, always imparts an oriental
air to it. To this, the Canadian, gay, thoughtless, ever bent on
the present, and caring nothing for to-morrow, adds another
phase. The trader, or interior clerk, who takes his outfit of
goods to the Indians, and spends eleven months of the year in
toil, and want, and petty traffic, appears to dissipate his means with
a sailor-like improvidence in a few weeks, and then returns to his
forest wanderings; and boiled corn, pork, and wild rice again supply
his wants. There is in these periodical resorts to the central
quarters of the Fur Company, much to remind one of the old
feudal manners, in which there is proud hospitality and a show
of lordliness on the one side, and gay obsequiousness and cringing
dependence on the other, at least till the annual bargains
for the trade are closed.</p>

<p>We were informed that there is neither school, preaching, a
physician (other than at the garrison), nor an attorney, in the place.
There are, however, courts of law, a post-office, and a jail, and
one or more justices of the peace.</p>

<p>There is a fish market every morning, where may be had the
trout&mdash;two species&mdash;and the white fish, the former of which are
caught with hooks in deep water, and the latter in gill nets.
Occasionally, other species appear, but the trout and white fish,
which is highly esteemed, are staples, and may be relied on in
the shore market daily; whole canoe-loads of them are brought in.</p>

<p>The name of this island is said to signify a great turtle, to which
it has a fancied resemblance, when viewed from a distance. Mikenok
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>,
and not Mackenok, is, however, the name for a tortoise. The
term, as pronounced by the Indians, is Michinemockinokong,
signifying place of the Great Michinamockinocks, or rock-spirits.
Of this word, <i>Mich</i> is from <i>Michau</i> (adjective-animate), great. The
term <i>mackinok</i>, in the Algonquin mythology, denotes in the singular,
a species of spirits, called turtle spirits, or large fairies, who
are thought to frequent its mysterious cliffs and glens. The
plural of this word, which is an animate plural, is <i>ong</i>, which is
the ordinary form of all nouns ending in the vowel <i>o</i>. When
the French came to write this, they cast away the Indian local in
<i>ong</i>, changed the sound of <i>n</i> to <i>l</i>, and gave the force <i>mack</i>
and <i>nack</i>, to <i>mök</i> and <i>nök</i>. The vowel <i>e</i>, after the first syllable,
is merely a connective in the Indian, and which is represented in
the French orthography in this word by <i>i</i>. The ordinary interpretation
of great turtle is, therefore, not widely amiss; but in
its true meaning, the term enters more deeply into the Indian
mythology than is conjectured. The island was deemed, in a
peculiar sense, the residence of spirits during all its earlier ages.
Its cliffs, and dense and dark groves of maples, beech, and ironwood,
cast fearful shadows; and it was landed on by them in
fearfulness, and regarded far and near as the <i>Sacred Island</i>. Its
apex is, indeed, the true Indian Olympus of the tribes, whose
superstitions and mythology peopled it by gods, or monitos.</p>

<p>Since our arrival here, there has been a great number of Indians
of the Chippewa and Ottowa tribes encamped near the town. The
beach of the lake has been constantly lined with Indian wigwams
and bark canoes. These tribes are generally well dressed in their
own costume, which is light and artistic, and exhibit physiognomies
with more regularity of features and mildness of expression
than it is common to find among them. This is probably attributable
to a greater intermixture of blood in this vicinity. They
resort to the island, at this season, for the purpose of exchanging
their furs, maple-sugar, mats, and small manufactures. Among
the latter are various articles of ornament, made by the females,
from the fine white deer skin, or yellow birch bark, embroidered
with colored porcupine quills. The floor mats, made from rushes,
are generally more or less figured. Mockasins, miniature sugarboxes,
called mo-cocks, shot-pouches, and a kind of pin and needleholders,
or housewives, are elaborately beaded. But nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
exceeds in value the largest merchantable mockocks of sugar,
which are brought in for sale. They receive for this article six
cents per pound, in merchandise, and the amount made in a season,
by a single family, is sometimes fifteen hundred pounds. The
Ottowas of L'Arbre Croche are estimated at one thousand souls,
which, divided by five, would give two hundred families; and by
admitting each family to manufacture but two hundred pounds
per annum, would give a total of forty thousand pounds; and
there are probably as many Chippewas within the basins of Lakes
Huron and Michigan. This item alone shows the importance of
the Indian trade, distinct from the question of furs.</p>

<p>During the time we remained on this island, the atmosphere
denoted a mean temperature of 55° Fahrenheit. The changes
are often sudden and great. The island is subject to be enveloped
in fogs, which frequently rise rapidly. These fogs are sometimes so
dense, as to obscure completely objects at but a short distance. I
visited Round Island one day with Lieut. Mackay,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[30]</a> and we were
both engaged in taking views of the fort and town of Michilimackinac,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[31]</a>
when one of these dense fogs came on, and spread itself with
such rapidity, that we were compelled to relinquish our designs
unfinished, and it was not without difficulty that we could make
our way across the narrow channel, and return to the island.
This fact enabled me to realize what the old travellers of the
region have affirmed on this topic.</p>

<p>We were received during our visit here in the most hospitable
manner, as well as with official courtesy, by Capt. B. K. Pierce, the
commanding officer, Major Puthuff, the Indian agent, and by the
active and intelligent agents of Mr. John Jacob Astor, the great
fiscal head of the Fur Trade in this quarter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Proceed down the north shore of Lake Huron to the entrance of the Straits of St.
Mary's&mdash;Character of the shores, and incidents&mdash;Ascend the river to Sault de Ste.
Marie&mdash;Hostilities encountered there&mdash;Intrepidity of General Cass.</p>

<p>Having spent six days on the island, rambling about it, and
making ourselves as well acquainted with its features and inhabitants
as possible, we felt quite recruited and cheered up, after the
tedious delays along the southern shores of Lake Huron. And
we all felt the better prepared for plunging deeper into the
northwestern forest. Before venturing into the stronghold of
the Chippewas, whose territories extend around Lake Superior,
it was deemed prudent to take along an additional military force
as far as Sault de Ste. Marie. But five or six years had then
passed since this large tribe had been arrayed in hostilities
against the United States (in the war of 1814), and they were yet
smarting under the wounds and losses which they had received
at Brownstown and the River Thames, where they had lost some
prominent men. Generals Brown and Macomb,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[32]</a> when making
a reconnoissance, with their respective staffs, a couple of years
before, had been fired on in visiting Gros Cape, at the foot of
Lake Superior, and although no one was killed on that occasion,
the circumstance was sufficient to indicate their feeling.</p>

<p>This additional force was placed under the command of Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
John S. Pierce, U. S. A., a brother of the commanding
officer,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[33]</a> and of Franklin Pierce, President of the United States. It
consisted of twenty-two men, with a twelve-oared barge. The
whole expedition, now numbering sixty-four persons, embarked
at ten o'clock on the 15th, with a fair wind, for our first destination,
at Detour, being the west cape of the Straits of St. Mary's.
The distance is estimated at forty miles, along a very intricate,
masked shore of islands, called Chenos. The breeze carried us
at the rate of five miles per hour. The first traverse is an arm of
the Lake, three leagues across, over which we passed swimmingly.
This traverse is broken near its eastern terminus by Goose
Island, the Nekuhmenis (literally Brant Island) of the Chippewas&mdash;a
noted place of encampment for traders. We did not,
however, touch at it. A couple of miles beyond this brought
us to Outard Point, where the men rested a few moments
on their oars and paddles. This point forms the commencement
of those intricate channels which constitute the Chenos group.
Our steersman gave them, however, a wide berth, and did not
approach near the shore till it began to be time to look out for
the mouth of the St. Mary's. After passing Point St. Vitel, a
distance of about thirty miles, the guides led into a sandy bay,
under the impression that we had reached the west cape of the
St. Mary's; but in this we were deceived. While landing here
a few moments, in a deep bay, the animal called Kaug by
the Chippewas (a porcupine), was discovered and killed by one
of the men, called Baptiste, by a blow from a hatchet. Buffon
gives two engravings of this animal, as found in Canada, under
separate names; but it is apprehended that he has been misled by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the same animal seen in its summer and winter dress. To the
Indian, this animal is valuable for its quills, which are dyed of
bright colors, to ornament their dresses, moccasons, shot-pouches,
and other choice fabrics of deer skin, or birch bark. This animal
has four claws on the fore paw, and five on the hinder ones. It
has small ears hid in the hair, and a bushy tail, with coarse black
and white hair. The specimen killed would weigh eight pounds.</p>

<p>Soon after coming out from this indentation of the lake, we
came in sight of Point Detour, on turning which, from E. to N.,
we found no longer use for sails. Mackenzie places this point
in north latitude 45° 54´.</p>

<p>The geology of this coast appears manifest. Secondary compact
limestone appears in place, in low situations, on the reef of
Outard Island and Point, and in the approach to Point Detour.
A ridge of calcareous highlands appears on the mainland east of
Michilimackinac, stretching off towards Sault de Ste. Marie, in a
northeast direction. This ridge appears to belong to a low
mountain chain, of which the Island of Michilimackinac may be
deemed as one of the geological links. Just before turning, we
passed a very heavy angular block of limestone, much covered
with moss, which could not have been far removed, in the drift
era, from its parent bed. The largest angle of this stone, which
I have since examined, must be eight or ten feet. This block is
of the ortho-cerite stratum of Drummond Island. The shores
are heavily charged with various members of the boulder drift,
with a fringe beyond them of spruce and firs, giving one the idea
of a cold, exposed, and most unfavorable coast. Turning the
Point of Detour, we ascended the strait a few miles, and encamped
on its west shore, off Frying-pan Island, at a point directly opposite
the British post of Drummond Island, which we could not
perceive, but the direction of which was clearly denoted by the
sound of the evening bugles.</p>

<p>The entrance into this strait forms a magnificent scene of waters
and islands, of which a map conveys but a faint conception. The
straits here appeared to be illimitable, we seemed to be in a
world of waters. It is stated to be thirty miles across to Point
Thessalon. The large group of the Manatouline Islands, stretching
transversely through Lake Huron, terminates with the isle
Drummond&mdash;a name bestowed in compliment to the bold leader,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Col. Drummond, who led the night storming party, and was blown
up on the bastion of Fort Erie, in 1813. This station was first
occupied on the withdrawal of the British troops from Mackinac,
in 1815. This day's trip gave us a favorable idea of canoe
travelling. It also gave us an exalted idea of the gigantic system
of these lake waters, and their connecting straits. We had
never done gazing at the prospect before us, after turning the Detour,
and did not retire from our camp fires early. The next
morning we embarked at five o'clock, a light dreamy mist hanging
over the waters. When this cleared away, we descried the ruined
chimneys and buildings of St. Joseph, the abandoned British
post burned by Col. Croghan, in 1814.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[34]</a> The day turned out a
fine one, and we proceeded up the straits with pleasurable feelings,
excited by the noble and novel views of scenery continually
before us. Keeping the west side of a high limestone island
called Isle a la Crosse, we then entered a sheet of water called Lac
Vaseau, or Muddy Lake. We had proceeded northwardly perhaps
twenty miles, when we encountered another of those large
islands for which these straits are remarkable, called Nebeesh,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[35]</a>
or Sailor's Encampment Island. Our guides held up on its western
side, which soon brought us to the first rapids, and the commencement
of St. Mary's River. A formation of sandstone is here observed
in the bed of the stream. The waters are swift and shallow,
and the men encountered quite a struggle in the ascent, and
so much injured one of our canoes that it became necessary to unlade
and mend it. In the mean time, the atmosphere put on a
threatening aspect, with heavy peals of thunder, but no rain followed
till we again re-embarked and proceeded five or six miles,
when a shower fell. It did not, however, compel us to land, and
by six o'clock in the afternoon, the sky again became clear. We
had now ascended the strait and river so far, that it became certain
we could reach our destination before night, and the men
worked with the greater alacrity. At eight o'clock we had surmounted
the second rapid, called the Little Rapid, Nebeetung of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the Indians, where we encountered a swift current. We were
now within two miles of our destination. The whole river is here
embodied before the eye, and is a mile or three-fourths of a mile
wide, and the two separate villages on the British and American
shores began to reveal themselves to view, with the cataract of
the Sault de Ste. Marie in the distance; and a beautiful forest of
elms, oaks, and maples on either hand. We ascended with our
flags flying, our little squadron being spread out in order, and
the Canadian boatmen raising one of their enlivening songs.
Long before reaching the place, a large throng of Indians had
collected on the beach, who, as we put in towards the shore, fired
a salute, and stood ready to greet us with their customary <i>bosho</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[36]</a>
We landed in front of the old Nolan house,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[37]</a> the ancient headquarters
of the Northwest Company; and immediately formed our
encampment on the wide green, extending along the river. Daylight
in this latitude is protracted, and although we had ascended
a computed distance of forty-five miles, and had had the mishap
to break a canoe in the Nebeesh, there was abundant light to fix
our encampment properly. Lieut. Pierce encamped his men on
our extreme right. Leaving an interval, Lieut. Mackay's escort
came next, and our tents formed the northern line of his encampment,
nearest to the Indians. The latter occupied a high plateau,
in plain view, several hundred yards west, with an intervening
gulley, and a plain, well-beat footpath. We had, in case of difficulty,
thirty-four muskets, Pierce's command included, in addition
to which, each of the savans, or Governor's mess, were armed with
a short rifle. Our line may have looked offensively demonstrative
to the Chippewas, who regarded it, from their ancient eminence,
with unfriendly feelings. These particulars are given from
the perilous position we were brought into next day.</p>

<p>Meantime, we passed a quiet night in our tents, where the deep
sound of the Falls fell on the wakeful ear, interspersed with the
distant monotonous thump of the Indian täwäegon. It required
but little observation, in the morning, to explore the village of
St. Mary's. It consisted of some fifteen or twenty buildings of all
sorts, occupied by descendants of the original French settlers, all
of whom drew their living from the fur trade. The principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>buildings and outhouses were those of Mr. John Johnston,
and the group formerly occupied by the Northwest Company.
Most of the French habitations stood in the midst of picketed
lots. There were about forty or fifty lodges, or two hundred
Chippewas, fifty or sixty of whom were warriors. But, although
this place was originally occupied as a missionary centre,
by the Roman Catholic missionaries of New France, about the
middle of the seventeenth century, no trace of the ancient church
could be seen, unless it was in an old consecrated graveyard,
which has continued to be used for interments. Mr. Johnston,
the principal inhabitant, is a native of the County of Antrim,
Ireland, where his connections are persons of rank. He is a polite,
intelligent, and well-bred man, from a manifestly refined circle;
who, soon after the close of the American Revolution, settled here,
and married the daughter of a distinguished Indian chief.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[38]</a> Although
now absent on a visit to Europe, his family received us
with marked urbanity and hospitality, and invited the gentlemen
composing the travelling family of Governor Cass to take all our
meals with them. Everything at this mansion was done with
ceremonious attention to the highest rules of English social life;
Miss Jane, the eldest daughter, who had received her education
in Ireland, presiding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The Sault (from the Latin <i>Saltus</i>, through the French) or Falls
of St. Mary, is the head of navigation for vessels on the lakes, and
has been, from early days, a thoroughfare for the Indian trade.
It is equally renowned for its white fish, which are taken in the
rapids with a scoop-net. The abundance and excellence of these
fish has been the praise of all travellers from the earliest date,
and it constitutes a ready means of subsistence for the Indians
who congregate here.</p>

<p>The place was chiefly memorable in our tour, however, as the
seat of the Chippewa power. To adjust the relations of the tribe
with the United States, a council was convened with the chiefs on
the day following our arrival. This council was assembled at
the Governor's <i>marquée</i>, which was graced by the national ensign,
and prepared for the interview with the usual presents. The
chiefs, clothed in their best habiliments, and arrayed in feathers
and British medals, seated themselves, with their usual dignity,
in great order, and the business was opened with the usual ceremony
of smoking the peace pipe. When this had been finished, and
the interpreter<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[39]</a> taken his position, he was directed to explain the
views of the Government, in visiting the country, to remind them
that their ancestors had formerly conceded the occupancy of the
place to the French, to whose national rights and prerogatives the
Americans had succeeded, and, by a few direct and well-timed
historical and practical remarks, to secure their assent to its reoccupancy.
The utmost attention was bestowed while this address
was being made, and it was evident, from the glances of the hearers,
that it was received with unfriendly feelings, and several chiefs
spoke in reply. They were averse to the proposition, and first
endeavored to evade it by pretending to know nothing of such
former grants. This point being restated by the American commissioner,
and pressed home strongly, was eventually dropped
by them. Still, they continued to speak in an evasive and desultory
manner, which had the effect of a negative. It was evident
that there was a want of agreement, and some animated discussion
arose among themselves. Two classes of persons appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>among the chiefs. Some appeared in favor of settling a boundary
to the ancient precinct of French occupancy, provided it was not
intended to be occupied by a garrison, saying, in the symbolic
language of Indians, that they were afraid, in that case, their young
men might kill the cattle of the garrison. Gov. Cass, understanding
this, replied that, as to the establishment of a garrison,
they need not give themselves any uneasiness&mdash;it was a settled
point, and so sure as the sun that was then rising would set, so
sure would there be an American garrison sent to that point,
whether they renewed the grant or not. This decisive language
had a sensible effect. High words followed between the chiefs.
The head chief of the band, Shingabawossin, a tall, stately man, of
prudent views, evidently sided with the moderates, and was evasive
in his speech. A chief called Shingwauk, or the Little Pine,
who had conducted the last war party from the village in 1814,
was inclined to side with the hostiles. There was a chief present
called Sassaba, a tall, martial-looking man, of the reigning family
of chiefs of the Crane Totem, who had lost a brother in the battle
of the Thames. He wore a scarlet uniform, with epaulets,
and nourished a deep resentment against the United States. He
stuck his war lance furiously in the ground before him, at the
beginning of his harangue, and, assuming a savage wildness of air,
appeared to produce a corresponding effect upon the other Indian
speakers, and employed the strongest gesticulation. His address
brought the deliberations to a close, after they had continued
some hours, by a defiant tone; and, as he left the <i>marquée</i>, he
kicked away the presents laid before the council. Great agitation
ensued. The council was then summarily dissolved, the Indians
went to their hill, and we to our tents.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the encampment of the Indians was
situated on an eminence a few hundred yards west from our position
on the shore, and separated from us by a small ravine. We
had scarcely reached our tents, when it was announced that the
Indians had raised the British flag in their camp. They felt their
superiority in number, and did not disguise their insolence.
Affairs had reached a crisis. A conflict seemed inevitable.
Governor Cass instantly ordered the expedition under arms.
He then called the interpreter, and proceeded with him, naked-handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and alone, to Sassaba's lodge at the hostile camp. Being
armed with short rifles, we requested to be allowed to accompany
him as a body-guard, but he decidedly refused this. On reaching
the lodge of the hostile chief, before whose door the flag had
been raised, he pulled it down with his own hands. He then
entered the lodge, and addressing the chief calmly but firmly, told
him that it was an indignity which they could not be permitted
to offer; that the flag was the distinguishing symbol of nationality;
that two flags of diverse kind could not wave in peace upon the
same territory; that they were forbid the use of any but our own,
and should they again attempt it, the United States would set a
strong foot upon their rock and crush them. He then brought
the captured flag with him to his tent.</p>

<p>In a few moments after his return from the Indian camp, that
camp was cleared by the Indians of their women and children,
who fled with precipitation in their canoes across the river. Thus
prepared for battle, we momently expected to hear the war-whoop.
I had myself examined and filled my shot-pouch, and stood ready,
rifle in hand, with my companions, awaiting their attack. But
we waited in vain. It was an hour of indecision among the
Indians. They deliberated, doubtingly, and it soon became evident
that the crisis had passed. Finding no hostile demonstration
from the hill, Lieuts. Pierce and Mackay directed their respective
commands to retire to their tents.</p>

<p>The intrepid act of Governor Cass had struck the Indians with
amazement, while it betokened a knowledge of Indian character
of which we never dreamed. This people possess a singular
respect for bravery. The march of our force, on that occasion,
would have been responded to, instantly, by eighty or a hundred
Indian guns; but to behold an unarmed man walk boldly
into their camp and seize the symbol of their power, betokened
a cast of character which brought them to reflection. On one
person in particular the act had a controlling effect. When it
was told to the daughter of Wäbojeeg (Mrs. Johnston), she told
the chief that their meditated scheme of resistance to the Americans
was madness; the day for such resistance was passed; and
this man, Cass, had the air of a great man, and could carry
his flag through the country. The party were also under the
hospitality of her roof. She counselled peace. To these words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Shingabowassin responded; he was seconded by Shingwäkonce,
or the Little Pine. Of this effort we knew nothing at the moment,
but the facts were afterwards learned. It was evident, before the
day had passed, that a better state of feeling existed among the
Indians. The chief Shingabowassin, under the friendly influences
referred to, renewed the negotiations. Towards evening a council
of the chiefs was convened in one of the buildings of this Pocahontean
counsellor, and the treaty of the 16th June, 1820 (<i>vide</i>
Ind. Treaties United States) signed. In this treaty every leading
man united, except Sassaba. The Little Pine signed it, under
one of his synonymous names, Lavoine Bart. By this treaty
the Chippewas cede four miles square, reserving the right of a
place to fish at the rapids, perpetually. The consideration for
this cession, or acknowledgment of title, was promptly paid in
merchandise.</p>

<p>The way being thus prepared for our entry into Lake Superior,
it was decided to proceed the next day. Before leaving this
point, it may be observed that the falls are produced by a stratum
of red sandstone rock, which crosses the bed of the St. Mary's at
this place. The last calcareous formation, seen in ascending the
straits, is at Isle a la Crosse. As we proceed north, the erratic
block stratum becomes heavier, and abraded masses of the granite,
trap, sandstone, and hornblende series are confusedly piled together
on the lake shores, and are abundant at the foot of these falls. In
the central or middle channel, the waters leap from a moderate
height, from stratum to stratum, at two or three points, producing
the appearance, when seen from below, of a mass of tumbling waves.
The French word <i>Sault</i> (pronounced <i>so</i>) accurately expresses this
kind of pitching rapids or falls. The Indians call it Bawateeg, or
Pawateeg, when speaking of the phenomenon, and Bawating or
Pawating, when referring to the place. Paugwa is an expression
denoting shallow water on rocks. The inflection <i>eeg</i> is an animate
plural. <i>Ing</i> is the local terminal form of nouns. In the
south or American channel, there is no positive leap of the water,
but an intensely swift current, which is parted by violent jets,
between rocks, still permitting canoes, skilfully guided, to descend,
and empty boats to be drawn up. But these falls are a
complete check to ship navigation. The descent of water has
been stated by Colonel Gratiot, of the United States Engineers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
at twenty-two feet ten inches.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[40]</a> They resemble a bank of rolling
foam, and with their drapery of trees on either shore, and the
mountains of Lake Superior in the distance, and the moving
canoes of fishing Indians in the foreground, present a most
animated and picturesque view.</p>

<p>To the Chippewas, who regard this spot as their ancient capital,
it is doubtless fraught with many associations, and they regard
with jealousy the advance of the Americans to this quarter.
This tribe, in the absence of any older traditions, are regarded as
the aboriginal inhabitants of the place. They are, by their language,
Algonquins, and speak a pure dialect of it. They call
themselves Ojibwas. <i>Bwa</i>, in this language, denotes voice, Ojibwamong
signifies Chippewa language, or voice. It is not manifest
what the prefixed syllable denotes. They are a numerous
people, and spread over many degrees of latitude and longitude.
We have had them constantly around us, in some form, since
leaving Detroit, and they extend to the Great Winnipeg Lake
of Hudson's Bay. They appear, at the French era of discovery,
to have been confined almost exclusively to the north bank of
the St. Lawrence, below the influx of the Ottowa River, extending
to Lake Nepising, and the geographical position seems to
have been the origin of the name Algonquin.</p>

<p>Whilst encamped here, we witnessed the descent down the
rapids of eleven barges and canoes laden with furs from the north.
This trade forms the engrossing topic, at this point, with all
classes. Hazardous as it is, the pursuit does not fail to attract
adventurers, who appear to be fascinated with the wild freedom
of life in the wilderness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Embark at the head of the portage at St. Mary's&mdash;Entrance into Lake Superior&mdash;Journey
and incidents along its coasts&mdash;Great Sand Dunes&mdash;Pictured Rocks&mdash;Grand
Island&mdash;Keweena peninsula and portage&mdash;Incidents thence to Ontonagon
River.</p>

<p>Having accomplished the object of our visit, at this place,
no time was lost in pushing our way into the basin of Lake
Superior. The distance to it is computed to be fifteen miles
above the Sault. It was nine o'clock of the morning following
the day of the treaty, when the men began to take the canoes up
the rapids, and transport the provisions and baggage. This
occupied nearly the whole of the day. Taking leave of Lieutenant
Pierce, who returned with his command, from this point
and our hospitable hostess, we proceeded to the head of the portage,
long before the canoes and stores all arrived. To while
away the time, while the men were thus employed, we tried our
skill at rifle shooting. It was six o'clock in the evening before
the work of transportation was finished, and the canoes loaded,
when we embarked. The view from the head of the portage is
imposing. The river spreads out like an arm of the sea. In the
distance appear the mountains of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>We proceeded two leagues, and encamped at Point aux Pins,
on the Canadian shore. At six o'clock the next morning we
were again in our canoes, and crossed the strait, which is here
several leagues wide, to the west, or Point Iroquois Cape. In this
traverse we first beheld the entrance into Lake Superior. The
scene is magnificent, and I could fully subscribe to the remark
made by Carver, "that the entrance into Lake Superior affords
one of the most pleasing prospects in the world." The morning
was clear and pleasant, with a favoring breeze, but a tempest of
wind and rain arose, with severe thunder, soon after we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
accomplished the passage, which compelled us hastily to land on
the Point Iroquois shore. This storm detained us five or six
hours before the waters were sufficiently calm to embark. Among
the boulders, I picked up a fine specimen of graphic granite,
most perfectly characterized. About two o'clock, we entered this
great inland sea. How feeble and inadequate are all geographical
attempts to describe this vast body of water, with its imposing
headlands, shores, and islands. The St. Mary's River passes out
between two prominent capes, called Gros Cape and Point Iroquois.
The former rises up in elevated barren peaks of sienite and
hornblende rock; the latter consists of nearly equally elevated
masses of horizontal red sandstone, covered with a dense forest. The
line of separation is, perhaps, three leagues, forming a geological
gap, through which, at ancient periods, the drift and boulder
strata has been forced, with an amazing power. For we find
these boulders, of the disrupted sienites, hornblende, trap, and
sandstone rocks of these northern latitudes heaped in profusion
along the entire shores of the river, and cast out, far and wide,
into the basin of Lake Huron.</p>

<p>There is a little island, called Isle des Iroquois, just off the foot
of the American cape, which is a noted stopping-place for boat
and canoe voyagers. On passing this spot, the lake spreads out
like a sea. Towards the north, can be seen on the horizon the
blue peaks of distant mountains. Southerly, the Point Iroquois
formation of sandstone appears skirting the shore, at several miles
distance. At the computed distance of fifteen miles, we passed the
mouth of the Taquimenon River. It was already evening when we
came here, but we were far out from shore, and the guides thought
best to keep on their course a league farther, which brought us,
at 11 o'clock at night, into the mouth of the Onzig, or Shelldrake
River. At this spot, we found an encampment of Chippewa
Indians, who were friendly, and quite profuse in their salutation
of <i>bosho</i>. At the moment we were ready to embark, the next
morning, a brigade of traders' boats, on the route to Michilimackinac,
was descried, coming in to the same point. This interview
detained us till 8 o'clock. Within a league, we met eighteen
or twenty Chippewa canoes on their journey towards the same
point; and at the computed distance of three leagues from the
Onzig, we reached, and turned the bleak shores of White-Fish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Point, called Namikong<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[41]</a> by the Indians. Thus far, we had been
imbayed in an arm of the lake which embraces Parisian Island,
another link of the sandstone formation; but here the lake, stretching
westwardly, displays itself in all its magnificence. On the left,
spreads a long line of sandy coast; on the right, an illimitable
expanse of water, which was bounded only by the horizon. Beyond
these features, there is not a prominent object to catch the
eye. The magnificence which first pleases, at last tires. The
change of course brought the wind ahead, and we were soon
compelled to land on these bleak sandy wastes. While thus
detained, an express canoe from St. Mary's reached us with letters.
A couple of hours were employed in dispatching this canoe on its
return; meantime the wind lulled, and we went on ten miles and
encamped on the sands.</p>

<p>The next morning, we were again in motion at five o'clock.
Twelve miles coasting along this unvaried shore, brought us to
the mouth of a stream called Neezhoda, Seepe,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[42]</a> or Twin River,
which is imprecisely called Two-Hearted River by the traders.
The peculiarity of this stream consists in the union of two separate
rivers, near the point of its outlet. Seven leagues beyond
this spot brought us to the inlet called Grande Marais. Immediately
west of this begins an elevated naked coast of sand-dunes,
called Gitche Nägow,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[43]</a> or La Grande Sables. To comprehend
the geology of this coast, it is necessary to state that it consists
of several heavy strata of the drift era, reaching a height
of two or three hundred feet, with a precipitous front on the lake.
The sands driven up by the lake are blown over these heights,
forming a heavy deposit. It is this sandy deposit, falling down
the face of the precipice, that appears to convert the whole formation
into dunes, whereon the sandy coating rests, like a veil,
over the pebble and clay-drift. Their desert and Sahara-like appearance
is quite impressive to the travellers who visit these coasts
in boats or canoes. The number of rapacious birds which are observed
about these heights, adds to the interest of the prospect.
Dr. Wolcott, and some other members of the party who ascended
the formation, reported a small lake on this elevation. The sands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
were observed, in some places, to be deposited over its vegetation
so as to arrest its growth. The largest trees were often half buried
and destroyed. Not less than nine miles of the coast, agreeably
to <i>voyageur</i> estimates, are thus characterized by dunes.</p>

<p>I found the sandstone formation of Cape Iroquois to reappear
at the western termination of these heights on the open shores of
the lake, where I noticed imbedded nodules of granular gypsum.
At this point, known to our men as La Pointe des Grandes Sables,
we pitched our tents, at nightfall, under a very threatening state
of the atmosphere. The winds soon blew furiously, followed by a
heavy rain-storm&mdash;and sharp thunder and lightning ensued. Our
line of tents stood on a gently rising beach, within fifty yards of
the margin of the lake, where they were prostrated during the
night by the violence of the waves. The rain still continued at
early daylight, the waves dashing in long swells upon the shore.
At sunrise the tempest abated, and by eight o'clock the atmosphere
assumed a calm and delightful aspect. It was eleven
o'clock, however, before the waves sufficiently subsided to permit
embarkation. Indeed, a perfect calm now ensued. This calm
proved very favorable&mdash;as we discovered on proceeding three
leagues&mdash;to our passing the elevated coast of precipitous rock,
called Ishpäbecä,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[44]</a> and Pictured Rocks. This coast, which extends
twelve miles, consists of a gray sandstone, forming a series
of perpendicular façades, which have been fretted, by the action
of the waves, into the rude architecture of pillared masses, and
open, cavernous arches. These caverns present their dark mouths
to observation as the voyager passes. At one spot a small stream
throws itself from the cliffs into the lake at one leap. In some
instances the cliffs assume a castellated appearance. At the spot
called the Doric Rock, near the commencement of these picturesque
precipices, a vast entablature rests on two immense rude pillars
of the water-worn mass. At a point called Le Portail, the vast
wall of rock had been so completely excavated and undermined
by the lake, that a series of heavy strata of rock rested solely on
a single pillar standing in the lake. The day was fine as we passed
these geological ruins, and we sat silently gazing on the changing
panorama. At one or two points there are small streams which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>break the line of rock into quadrangles. A species of dark
red clay overlies this formation, which has been carried by the
rains over the face of the cliffs, where, uniting with the atmospheric
sand and dust, it gives the whole line a pictorial appearance.
We almost held our breath in passing the coast;
and when, at night, we compared our observations around the
camp-fire, there was no one who could recall such a scene of
simple novelty and grandeur in any other part of the world; and
all agreed that, if a storm should have arisen while we were
passing, inevitable destruction must have been our lot. We
came to Grand Island at a seasonable hour in the evening, and
encamped on the margin of its deep and land-locked harbor. Our
camp was soon filled with Chippewas from a neighboring village.
They honored us in the evening by a dance. Among these
dancers, we were impressed with the bearing of a young and
graceful warrior, who was the survivor of a self-devoted war-party
of thirteen men, who, having marched against their ancient
enemies the Sioux, found themselves surrounded in the plain by
superior numbers, and determined to sell their lives at the dearest
rate. To this end, they dug holes in the earth, each of which
thus becoming a fortification for its inmate, who dared their adversaries
till overpowered by numbers. One person was selected
to return with the news of this heroic sacrifice; this person had
but recently returned, and it was from his lips that we heard the
tragic story.</p>

<p>My mineralogical searches along the shores this day rewarded
me with several water-worn fragments of agate, carnelian, zeolite,
and prase, which gave me the first intimation of our approach to
the trap and amygdaloidal strata, known to be so abundant in their
mineral affluence in this quarter.</p>

<p>We left Grand Island the next morning at six o'clock, and
passing through a group of sandstone islands, some of which had
had their horizontality disturbed, we came to the mouth of
Laughing-fish River, where a curious flux and reflux of water is
maintained. From this place, a line of sandstone coast was
passed, northwardly, till reaching its terminus on the bay of
Chocolate River. This is a large and deep bay, which it would
have required a day's travel to circumnavigate. To avoid this, the
men held their way directly across it, steering N. 70° W., which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
at the end of three leagues, brought us to Granite Point. Here
we first struck the old crystalline rocks or primitive formation.
This formation stretches from the north shores of the Gitche
Sebeeng,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[45]</a> or Chocolate River, to Huron Bay, and gives the traveller
a view of rough conical peaks. These characterize the
coast for a couple of days' travel. They are noted for immense
bodies of iron ore, which is chiefly in the condition of iron glance.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[46]</a>
At Presque Isle, it assumes the form of a chromate of iron in
connection with serpentine rock. We encamped on level ground
on a sandstone formation, in the rear of Granite Point, and had
an opportunity of observing the remarkable manner in which the
horizontal sandstone rests upon and against the granitical, or, more
truly, sienitic eminences. These sandstone strata lap on the
shoulders of the primitive or crystalline rocks, preserving their
horizontal aspect, and forming distinct cliffs along parts of the
coast. This sandstone appears, from its texture and position, to
be the "old red sandstone" of geologists.</p>

<p>The next morning (23d) we quitted our encampment at an
early hour, in a haze, and urged our way, with some fluctuations
of weather, an estimated distance of eleven leagues. This brought
us, at four o'clock in the afternoon, to Huron River. Sitting in
the canoe, in a confined position, makes one glad at every opportunity
to stretch his limbs, and we embraced the occasion to
bathe in the Huron. The shore consists of a sandy plain, where
my attention was called to the Kinnikenik, a plant much used
by the Indians for smoking. It is the <i>uva ursi</i>. I had seen it
once before, on the expedition, at Point aux Barques.</p>

<p>We inspected here, with much attention, an Indian grave, as
well from the care with which it was made, as the hieroglyphics
cut on the head-posts. The grave was neatly covered with bark,
bent over poles, and made roof-shaped. A pine stake was placed
at the head. Between this and the head of the grave, there was
placed a smooth tablet of cedar wood, with hieroglyphics. Mr.
Riley, our interpreter, explained these. The figure of a bear
denoted the chief or clan. This is the device called a Totem.
Seven red strokes denoted his scalp honors in Indian heraldry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
or that he had been seven times in battle. Other marks were
not understood or interpreted. A paling of saplings inclosed
the space.</p>

<p>On the following morning, our camp was astir at the customary
early hour, when we proceeded to Point aux Beignes, a distance
of six miles. Attaining this point, we entered Keweena Bay,
coasting up its shores for an estimated distance of three leagues.
We were then opposite the mouth of Portage River, but separated
from it a distance of twelve miles. I was seated in Lieutenant
Mackay's canoe. The whole squadron of five canoes
unhesitatingly put out. The wind was adverse; before much
progress had been made in crossing, three of our flotilla, after
struggling against the billows, put back; but we followed the
headmost one, which bore the Governor's flag, and, seizing hold of
the paddles to relieve the men, we succeeded in gaining the river.
The other canoes came up the next morning, at seven o'clock,
when we all proceeded to cross the Portage Lake, and up an
inlet, which soon exhibited a rank growth of aquatic plants, and
terminated, after following a very narrow channel, in a quagmire.
We had, in fact, reached the commencement of the Keweena
Portage.</p>

<p>Before quitting this spot, it may be well to say, that the geology
of the country had again changed. Portage Lake lies, in
fact, in the direction of the great copper-bearing trap dyke.
This dyke, estimating from the end of the peninsula, extends
nearly southwest and northeast, probably seventy miles, with a
breadth of ten miles. It is overlaid by rubblestone and amygdaloid,
which latter, by disintegration, yields the agates, carnelians,
and other silicious, and some sparry crystalline minerals,
for which the central shores of Lake Superior are remarkable.
Nearly every part of this broad and extensive dyke which has
been examined, yields veins, and masses of native copper, or copper
ores.</p>

<p>The word was, when we had pushed our canoes into the quagmire,
that each of the gentlemen of the party was to carry his
own personal baggage across the portage. This was an awkward
business for most of us. The distance was but two thousand
yards, but little over a mile, across elevated open grounds. I
strapped my trunk to my shoulders, and walked myself out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
breath in getting clear of the brushy part of the way, till reaching
the end of the first <i>pause</i>, or resting-place. Here I met the
Governor (Cass), who facetiously said: "You see I am carrying
<i>two</i> pieces," alluding to his canoe slippers, which he held in his
hands. "A <i>piece</i>," in the trade, is the back load of the <i>engagee</i>.</p>

<p>On reaching the termination of the second "pause," or rest, we
found ourselves on a very elevated part of the shore of Lake
Superior. The view was limitless, the horizon only bounding
the prospect. The waves rolled in long and furious swells from
the west. To embark was impossible, if we had had our baggage
all brought up, which was not the case. The day was quite
spent before the transportation was completed. This delay gave
us an opportunity to ramble about, and examine the shore. In
a boulder of serpentine rock, I found an imbedded mass of native
copper, of two pounds' weight. On breaking the stone, it proved
to be bound together by thin filaments of this metal. Small
water-worn fragments of chalcedony, agate, carnelian, and other
species of the quartz family were found strewn along the beach,
together with fragments of zeolite. Masses of the two former
minerals were also found imbedded in amygdaloid and trap-rock,
thus denoting the parent beds of rock. In the zeal which these
little discoveries excited on the subject of mineralogy, the Chippewa,
Ottowa, and Shawnee Indians attached to the expedition
participated, and as soon as they were made acquainted with the
objects sought, they became successful explorers. They had
noticed my devotion to the topic, from the time of our passing
the Islands of Shawangunk, Michilimackinac, and Flat-rock Point,
in the basin of Lake Huron, where organic forms were chiselled
from the rock; and bestowed on me the name of Paguäbëkiegä.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[47]</a></p>

<p>It turned out the next morning, that the whole of the baggage
and provisions had not been brought up, nor any of the canoes.
This work was early commenced by the men. About half the
day was employed in the necessary toil. When it was concluded,
the wind on the lake had become too high, blowing in an adverse
direction, to permit embarkation. Nothing remained but to submit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to the increased delay, during which we made ourselves as
familiar with the neighboring parts of the lake shore as possible.
During the time the expedition remained encamped at the portage,
I made a short excursion up the peninsula northeastwardly,
accompanied by Captain Douglass, Mr. Trowbridge, and some
other persons. The results of this trip are sufficiently comprehended
in what has already been stated respecting the geology
and mineralogy of this prominent peninsula.</p>

<p>On the following morning (27th) the wind proved fair, and
the day was one of the finest we had yet encountered on this
fretful inland sea. We embarked at half-past four A. M., every
heart feeling rejoiced to speed on our course. The prominent
headlands, west of this point, are capped, as those on its south-eastern
border, with red sandstone. The wind proved full and
adequate to bear us on, without endangering our safety, which
enabled the steersmen to hold out boldly, from point to point.
We had not proceeded far beyond the cliffs west of the portage,
when the dim blue outlines of the Okaug or Porcupine Mountains<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[48]</a>
burst on our view.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[49]</a> Their prominent outline seemed to stretch
on the line of the horizon directly across our track. The atmosphere
was quite transparent, and they must have been seen at
the distance of sixty miles. Captain Douglass thought, from the
curve of the earth, that they could not be less than eighteen
hundred feet in height. We successively passed the entrance of
Little Salmon-Trout, Graverod, Misery, and Firesteel Rivers, at
the latter of which a landing was made; when we again resumed
our course, and entered the Ontonagon River, at half-past three
in the afternoon. A large body of water enters the lake at the
spot, but its mouth is filled up very much by sands. One of
those curious refluxes is seen here, of which a prior instance has
been noticed, in which its waters, having been impeded and dammed
up by gales of wind, react, at their cessation, with unusual force.
The name of the River Ontonagon<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[50]</a> is, indeed, due to these refluxes,
the prized dish of an Indian female having, agreeably to
tradition, been carried out of the river into the lake.</p>

<p>Captain Douglass made observations for the latitude of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
place, and determined it to be in north latitude 46° 52´ 2´´. The
stationary distances of the route are given in the subjoined list,
in which it may be observed that they are probably exaggerated
about one-third by the voyagers and northwest traders, who
always pride themselves on going great distances; but they denote
very well, in all cases, the <i>relative</i> distances.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Chippewa village at the mouth of the Ontonagon&mdash;Organize an expedition to explore
its mineralogy&mdash;Incidents of the trip&mdash;Rough nature of the country&mdash;Reach
the copper rock&mdash;Misadventure&mdash;Kill a bear&mdash;Discoveries of copper&mdash;General
remarks on the mineral affluence of the basin of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>A small Chippewa village, under the chieftainship of Tshwee-tshweesh-ke-wa,
or the Plover, and Kundekund, the Net Buoy,
was found on the west bank of the river, near its mouth, the chiefs
and warriors of which received us in the most friendly manner.
If not originally a people of a serene and placid temperament,
they have been so long in habits of intercourse with the
white race that they are quite familiar with their manners and
customs, and mode of doing business. They appeared to regard the
Canadian-Frenchmen of our party as if they were of their own
mode of thinking, and, indeed, almost identical with themselves.</p>

<p>The Ontonagon River had, from the outset, formed an object
of examination, from the early and continued reports of copper
on its borders. It was determined to lose no time in examining
it. Guides were furnished to conduct a party up the river to
the locality of the large mass of this metal, known from early
days. This being one of the peculiar duties of my appointment,
I felt the deepest interest in its success, and took with me the
apparatus I had brought for cutting the rock and securing proper
specimens.</p>

<p>The party consisted of Governor Cass, Dr. Wolcott, Captain
Douglass, Lieutenant Mackay, J. D. Doty, Esq., and myself. We
embarked in two canoes, with their complement of men and
guides. It was six o'clock, when, leaving the balance of the expedition
encamped at the mouth of the river, east shore, we took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
our departure, in high spirits, for the copper regions. A broad
river with a deep and gentle current, with a serpentine channel,
and heavily wooded banks with their dark-green foliage overhanging
the water, rendered the first few miles of the trip delightful.
At the distance of four miles, we reached a sturgeon-fishery,
formed by extending a weir across the river. This weir consists
of upright and horizontal stakes and poles, along the latter of
which the Indians move and balance themselves, having in their
hands an iron hook on a pole, with which the fish are caught.
We stopped a few moments to look at the process, received some
of the fish drawn up during our stay, which are evidently the
<i>Acipenser oxyrinchus</i>, and went on a couple of miles higher, where
we encamped on a sandbar. Here we were welcomed, during
the sombre hours off the night, with a pertinacity we could have
well dispensed with, by the mosquitos.</p>

<p>We resumed the ascent at four o'clock in the morning. The
river is still characterized for some miles by rich alluvial banks,
bearing a dense forest of elm, maple, and walnut, with a luxuriant
growth of underbrush. But it was soon perceived that the
highlands close in upon it and narrow its channel, which murmurs
over dangerous beds of rocks and stones. Almost imperceptibly,
we found ourselves in an alpine region of a very rugged
character. The first rapid water encountered had been at the
Indian weir, on the 27th. These rapids, though presenting
slight obstacles, became more frequent at higher points. We
had been in our canoes about three hours, the river having become
narrower and more rapid, when the guides informed the
party that we had ascended as far into the mountainous district
as was practicable; that there was a series of bad rapids above;
and that, by landing at this spot, the party could proceed, with
guides, to the locality of the copper rock. Accordingly, arrangements
were made to divide the party; Governor Cass placed at
my service the number of men necessary to explore the country
on foot, and carry the implements. Dr. Wolcott and Captain
Douglass joined me. I took my departure with eight persons,
including two Indian guides, in quest of the mineral region, over
the highlands on the west bank of the river; while the Governor,
Major Forsyth, and the other guides, remained with the canoes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
which were lightened of half their burden, in hopes of their being
able to ascend the stream quite to the Rock. Starting with my
party with alacrity, this trip was found to be one of no ordinary
toil.</p>

<p>Not only was the country exceedingly rough, carrying us up
and down steep depressions, but the heat of the sun, together
with the exercise, was oppressive, nor did our guides seem to
move with a precision which betokened much familiarity with
the region, if they did not feel, indeed, some compunction on
leading whites to view their long superstitiously concealed mineral
treasures. At one o'clock we came to an Indian path, leading
directly to the place. The guides here sat down to await the party
under Governor Cass, who were expected to join us at this spot.
The thermometer at this hour stood at 90° in the shade of the
forest. We had not been long seated when the other party made
their appearance; but the Governor had been so much exhausted
by clambering up the river hills, that he determined to return to
his point of landing in the river. In this attempt he was guided
by one of the Ontonagon Indians, named Wabiskipenais,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[51]</a> who
missed his way, and wandered about he knew not whither. We
leave him to thread his way back into the valley, with the Executive
of the Territory, wearied and perplexed, at his heels, while
the results of my excursion in search of the copper rock are detailed.
After the reunion at the path, my mineralogical party
proceeded some five or six miles, by estimation, farther, through
a more favorable region, towards the object of search. On
approaching the river, they passed some antique excavations
in the forest, overgrown with saplings, which had the appearance
of age, but not of a remote age. Coming to the brink of the
river, we beheld the stream brawling over a rapid stony bed,
at the depth of, perhaps, eighty or a hundred feet below. Towards
this, its diluvial banks, charged with boulders and pebbles,
sloped at a steep angle. At the foot, laid the large mass we were
in search of, partly immersed in the water. Its position may be
inferred from the following sketch:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-097.jpg" class="border" width="563" height="252" alt="" /> </div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 1</p>

<p>The rock consists of a mass of native copper in a tabular
boulder of serpentine. Its face is almost purely metallic, and
more splendent than appears to consist with its being purely
metallic copper. There is no appearance of oxidation. Its size,
roughly measured, is three feet four inches, by three feet eight
inches, and about twelve or fourteen inches thick in the thickest
part. The weight of copper, exclusive of the rock, is not readily
estimated; it may be a ton, or a ton and a half. Old authors
report it at more than double this weight. The quantity has
been, however, much diminished by visitors, who have cut freely
from it. I obtained adequate specimens, but found my chisels too
highly tempered, and my hammer not heavy enough to separate
large masses. Having made the necessary examinations, we took
our way back up the elevated banks of the river, and across the
forest about six miles, to the final place of debarkation of Gov.
Cass and his party. But our fears were at once excited on learning
that the Governor, with his guide, Wabishkepenais, had not
reached the camp. It was already beginning to be dark, and the
gloom of night, which is impressive in these solitudes, was fast
closing around us. Guns were fired, to denote our position, and
a light canoe was immediately manned, placed in charge of one
of the gentlemen, and sent up the river in search. This canoe
had not proceeded a mile, when the object of search was descried,
with his companions, sitting on the banks of the river, with a
real jaded air, with his Indian guide standing at no great distance.
Wabishkepenais had been bewildered in his tracks, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
finally struck the river by the merest chance. The Governor, on
reaching camp, looked as if he had been carried over steeps and
through gloomy defiles, which had completely exhausted his
strength, and he was not long in retiring to his tent, willing to
leave such rough explorations for the present, at least, to other persons,
or, if he ever resumed them, to do it with better guides. Poor
Wabishkepenais looked chagrined and as woebegone himself as
if he had encountered the bad influences of half the spirits of
his Indian mythology; for the fellow had really been lost in his
own woods, and with a charge by whom he had felt honored, and
employed his best skill to conduct. The camp-fires already threw
their red glare among the trees as night spread her sable pall
over us. The tents were pitched; the canoes turned up on the
shore to serve as a canopy for the men to sleep under. Indians
and Canadians were soon engaged at their favorite pipes, and
mingled their tones and hilarious conversation; and we finally
all slept the sounder for our eventful day's toils and misadventures.
But deeply printed on our memory, and long to remain
there, are the thrilling scenes of that day and that night.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the next morning, the entire camp was roused
and in motion, when we began to descend the stream. We had
descended about ten miles, when the Ontonagon Indians stopped
the canoes to examine a bear-fall, on the east bank. It was a fine
open forest, elevated some six or eight feet above the water. It
was soon announced that a bear was entrapped. We all ascended
the bank, and visited the locality. The structure had been so
planned that the animal must needs creep lowly under a crib of
logs to get at the bait, which he no sooner disturbed than a weight
of logs fell on his prostrated legs. The animal sat up partially
on his fore paws, when we advanced, the hinder being pressed
heavily to the earth. One of the Indians soon fired a ball through
his head, but it did not kill him, he still kept his upright position.
Dr. Wolcott then requested permission to fire a shot,
which was aimed at the heart, and took effect about that part,
but did not kill him. One of the Indians then dispatched him
with an axe. He was no sooner dead than one of the Indians,
stepping up, addressed him by the name <i>Muk-wah</i>, shook him by
the paw, with a smiling countenance, saying, in the Indian language,
that he was sorry they had been under the necessity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
killing him, and hoped the offence would be forgiven, as one of
the shots fired had been from an American.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[52]</a></p>

<p>This act of the Indian addressing the bear, will be better
understood, when it is stated that their mythology tells them, that
the spirit of the animal must be encountered in a future state,
when the enchantment to which it is condemned in this life, will
be taken off.</p>

<p>On passing down the river, an Indian had promised to disclose
another mass of native copper, near the river, and we stopped at
a spot indicated, to enable him to bring it. Whether he repented
of his too free offer, agreeably to Indian superstition, or feared
some calamity to follow the disclosure, or really encountered
some difficulty in finding it, I know not, but it is certain that,
after some time spent in the search, or affected search, he came
back to the river without producing it.</p>

<p>Soon after this incident, we reached the mouth of the river,
and found the party left encamped at that point, in charge of
Mr. Trowbridge and Mr. Doty, well, nothing having occurred in
our absence. The wind was, however, adverse to our embarkation,
had it been immediately desired.</p>

<p>A council of the Ontonagon Indians was summoned, which
met in the after part of the day; speeches were delivered, and replied
to, and presents distributed. A silver medal was presented
to Wabishkepenais.</p>

<p>Head winds continuing, we were farther detained at this spot
the following day. While thus detained, an Ontonagon Indian
brought in a mass of native copper, from the banks of this river,
weighing eight or nine pounds. This mass was of a flattened,
orbicular shape, and its surface coated with a green oxide. At a
subsequent part of my acquaintance with this river, another mass
of native copper (still deposited in my cabinet) was brought to me,
from the east fork of the river, which weighed from forty to fifty
pounds. This mass, of a columnar shape, originally embraced a
piece of stone which the Indian finding it had detached. It was
also coated with a dark green oxide of copper. Both of these
masses appeared to have been volcanic. Neither of them had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the slightest traces of gangue, or vein-matter, nor of attrition in
being removed from the parent beds. The following sketches
depict the shapes of these masses.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-100.jpg" width="500" height="289" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 2 and Fig. 3</p>

<p>With respect to the general question of the mineral character
of this part of the country, and the probable value of its mineral
and metallic deposits to the public domain, the entire class of
facts, from which a judgment must be formed, are favorable.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[53]</a>
Salts and oxides of copper are not only seen in various places in
its stratification, but these indications of mineral wealth in this
article are confirmed, by the subsequent discovery of masses of
native copper, along the shore, and imbedded in its traps and
amygdaloids. In addition to the opportunities of observation
furnished by this expedition, subsequent public duties led me to
perform seven separate trips along its shores, and each of these
but served to accumulate the evidences of its extraordinary
mineral wealth. Indications of the sulphurets, arseniates, and
other ores of this metal are found in the older class of horizontal
rocks; but it is to the trap-rocks alone that we must look for
the veins of native metal. Some of these masses contain silver,
in a state of combination. Traces of this metal, chiefly in the
boulder form, are found in the metalliferous horizontal strata.
Nor is there wanting evidence, that there are localities of virgin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>copper, which do not promise a considerable percentage of the
metal. A mass of steatite, imbedding a heavy mass of pure
native silver, which had been probably carried from the northwest,
with the drift stratum, was found cast out quite into the
Huron basin; and this rock, in its intimate associations with the
serpentine formation of Lake Superior, should be closely scrutinized.
There is also a formation of slate and quartz in the
primitive district, which is entitled to particular attention.</p>

<p>Inorganic masses are developed, throughout the globe, without
regard to climate. Russia yields the precious metals in great
profusion, and there are no laws governing the distribution of
these metals, which forbid the expectation that they should be
abundantly disclosed by the stratification of the basin of Lake
Superior. With respect to the useful metals, particularly copper
and iron, it is undeniably the richest and most extensive locality
of these metals on the globe.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[54]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Proceed along the southern coast of Lake Superior from the Ontonagon, to Fond
du Lac&mdash;Porcupine range of mountains&mdash;Streams that run from it, at parallel
distances, into the lake&mdash;La Pointe&mdash;Group of the Federation Islands&mdash;River
St. Louis&mdash;Physical geography of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Head winds detained the expedition at the mouth of the Ontonagon,
during the day and the day following that of our arrival
from the copper rock. It was the first of July, at half-past four
o'clock, A. M., when the state of the lake permitted us to embark.
Steering west, we now had the prominent object of the Porcupine
Mountains constantly in view. At the distance of fifteen miles,
we passed the Pewabik Seebe, or Iron River. This stream, after
ascending it a couple of miles, is a mere torrent, pouring from
the Porcupine Mountains, over a very rough bed of grauwakke,
which forbids all navigation. At the computed distance of five
leagues beyond this stream, we passed the river called Pusábika,
or Dented River, so called from standing rocks, which resemble
broken human teeth. The Canadians, who, as previously
remarked, appear to have had but a limited geographical vocabulary,
called this Carp River, neglectful of the fact that they
had already bestowed the name on a small river which flows into
the bay south of Granite Point.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[55]</a> We were now at the foot of
the Kaug range, which is one vast upheaval of trap-rock, and
has lifted the chocolate-colored sandstone, at its base, into a vertical
position. The Pusábika River originates in this high trap
range, from which it is precipitated, at successive leaps, to the level
of the lake, the nearest of which, a cascade of forty feet, is within
three miles of the river's mouth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>Six miles further brought us to the Presque Isle River of the
Canadians, for which I heard no Indian name. It also originates
on this lofty trap range, and has worn its bed through frightful
chasms in the grauwackke, through which it enters the lake.
Within half a mile of its entrance, the river, hastening from its
elevations, drops into a vast cauldron scooped in the grauwackke
rock, whence it glides into the lake. Here are some picturesque
and sublime views, worthy the pencil.</p>

<p>Two leagues beyond this river we reached and passed the
entrance of Black River, another of the streams from the Kaug
range. It is stated to be rapid, and to have its source south of
the mountains, in a district sheltered from the lake winds, and
suited to agriculture. Its borders bear at the same time indications
of mineral wealth. Eight miles beyond this river, we
encamped on the open shores of the lake, after travelling fifty
miles. Having been doubled up in the canoe for all this distance,
landing on terra firma, and being able to stretch one's legs, seemed
quite a relief. "I will break a lance with you," quoth A to B,
addressing Mr. Trowbridge, offering him at the same time a dried
stalk, which had been cast up by the waves. We were, in fact,
as much pleased to get ashore, after the day's confinement, as so
many boys let loose from confinement in school. In strolling
along the shore, I recognized the erismatolite, in the dark upheaved
sandstone at this locality.</p>

<p>We here observed a phenomenon, which is alluded to by Charlevoix
as peculiar to this lake. Although it was calm, and had
been so all day, save a light breeze for a couple of hours after
leaving the Ontonagon, the waters near shore were in a perfect
rage, heaving and lashing upon the rocks, in a manner which
rendered it difficult to land. At the same time, scarce a breath
of air was stirring, and the atmosphere was beautifully serene.</p>

<p>On passing thirteen miles, the next morning, we reached the
mouth of the Montreal River, which is the last of the mountain
streams of the Kaug range. It throws itself from a high precipice
of the vertical sand-rock, within sight of the lake, creating
quite a picturesque view.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[56]</a> (Vide
<i>Information respecting the History,
Customs, and Prospects of Indian Tribes</i>, vol. iv. plate 26.)</p>

<p>On landing here a few moments, at an early hour, the air being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>hazy, we knocked down some pigeons, which flew very low.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[57]</a>
This bird seems to be precisely the common pigeon of the Atlantic
borders. The Indians had constructed a fish-weir between
the lake and Montreal falls, where the lake sturgeon are caught.</p>

<p>After passing about a league beyond the Montreal, the voyager
reaches a curve in the lake shore, at which it bends to the north
and northwest. This curve is observed to extend to the De Tour
of the great bay of Fond du Lac, a computed distance of the
<i>voyageurs</i> of thirty-six miles, which, as before indicated, is about
one-third overrated. The immediate shore is a level plain of
sand, which continues to Point Chegoimegon, say eighteen miles.
About two-thirds of this distance, the Muskeego<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[58]</a> River enters
through the sandy plain from the west. This is a large stream,
consisting of two primary forks, one of which connects it with
Chippewa River, and the other with the River St. Croix of the
Mississippi. The difficulties attending its ascent, from rapids and
portages, have led the French to call it Mauvaise, or Bad River.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[59]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Passing this river, we continued along the sandy formation to its
extreme termination, which separates the Bay of St. Charles by
a strait from that remarkable group of islands, called the Twelve
Apostles by Carwer. It is this sandy point, which is called La
Pointe Chagoimegon<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[60]</a> by the old French authors, a term now
shortened to La Pointe. Instead of "twelve," there are, however,
nearer thirty islands, agreeably to the subjoined sketch, by
which it is seen that each State in the Union may stand sponsor
for one of them, and they might be more appropriately called
the <i>Federation Group</i>. Touching at the inner or largest of the
group, we found it occupied by a Chippewa village, under a chief
called Bezhike. There was a tenement occupied by a Mr. M.
Cadotte, who has allied himself to the Chippewas. Hence we
proceeded about eleven miles to the main shore, where we
encamped at a rather late hour. I here found a recurrence of the
granitic, sienitic, and hornblende rocks, in high orbicular hills,
and improved the brief time of daylight to explore the vicinity.
The evening proved lowering and dark, and this eventuated in
rain, which continued all night, and until six o'clock the next
morning. Embarking at this hour, we proceeded northwest
about eight miles, to Raspberry River, and southwest to Sandy
River. Here we were driven ashore by a threatening tempest,
and before we had unladen the canoes, there fell one of the
most copious and heavy showers of rain. The water seemed
fairly to pour from the clouds. We had not pitched a tent, nor
could the slightest shelter be found. There seemed but one
option at our command, namely, that between sitting and standing.
We chose the latter, and looked at each other, it may be,
foolishly, while this rain tempest poured. When it was over, we
were as completely wetted as if it had been our doom to lay at
the bottom of the lake. When the rain ceased, the wind rose
directly ahead, which confined us to that spot the rest of the day.
The next day was the Fourth of July&mdash;a day consecrated in our
remembrance, but which we could do no more than remember.
The wind continued to blow adversely till about two o'clock,
when we embarked, not without feeling the lake still laboring
under the agitation into which it had been thrown. On travelling
three miles, we turned the prominent point, called De Tour of
Fond du Lac. At this point our course changed from northwest
to south-southwest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>The sandstone formation here showed itself for the last time.
The shore soon assumes a diluvial character, bordered with long
lines of yellow sand and pebbles. In some places, heavy beds
of pure iron sand were observed. The agitation which marked
the lake soon subsided, under the change of wind, and our men
seemed determined, by the diligence with which they worked, to
make amends for our delay at Sandy River.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the evening we came to Cranberry River
and encamped, having, by their estimation, come twenty-three
miles. The evening was perfectly clear and calm, with a striking
twilight, which was remarked all night. These lengthened twilights
form a very observable feature as we proceed north. Mackenzie
says that, in lat. 67° 47´, on the 11th of July, 1789, he saw
the sun above the horizon at twelve o'clock P.M.</p>

<p>The calmness and beauty of the night, and our chief's anxiety
to press forward, made this a short night. Gen. Cass aroused the
camp at a very early hour, so that at three o'clock we were again
upon the lake, urging our way up the Fond du Lac Bay. The
sun rose above the horizon at ten minutes before four o'clock.
The morning was clear and brilliant. Not a cloud obscured the
sky, and the waves of the lake spread out with the brightness of
a mirror. At the distance of five leagues, we passed the mouth
of the Wisakoda, or Broule River,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[61]</a> a stream which forms the
connecting link with the Mississippi River, through the St. Croix.
Three miles beyond this point we landed a short time, on the
shore, where we observed a stratum of iron sand, pure and black,
a foot in thickness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>At eleven o'clock, a northeast wind arose, which enabled the
expedition to hoist sail. Land on the north shore had for
some time been in sight, across the bay, and the line of coast
soon closed in front, denoting that we had reached the head of
the lake. At twelve o'clock, we entered the month of the River
St. Louis, having been eighteen days in passing this lake, including
the trip to the Ontonagon.</p>

<p>Before quitting Lake Superior, whose entire length we have
now traversed, one or two generic remarks may be made; and
the first respects its aboriginal name. The Algonquins, who, in
the Chippewa tribe, were found in possession of it, on the arrival
of the French, early in the seventeenth century, applied the same
radical word to it which they bestow on the sea, namely, Gum-ee
(Collected water), or, as it is sometimes pronounced, Gom-ee, or
Go-ma; with this difference, that the adjective big (gitchè) prefixed
to this term for Lake Superior, is repeated when it is applied
to the sea. The superlative is formed when it is meant to be
very emphatic, in this language, by the repetition of the adjective;
a principle, indeed, quite common to the Indian grammars
generally. The word did not commend itself to French or English
ears, so much as to lead to its adoption. By taking the
syllable Al from Algonquin, as a prefix, instead of gitchè, we
have the more poetic combination of Algoma.</p>

<p>Geographers have estimated the depth of this lake at nine hundred
feet. By the surveys of the engineers of the New York and
Erie Canal, the surface of Lake Erie is shown to be five hundred
and sixty feet above tide-water, which, agreeably to estimates kept
on the present journey, lies fifty-two feet below the level of Lake
Superior. These data would carry the bottom of the lake two hundred
and eighty-eight feet below tide water. What is more certain
is this, that it has been the theatre of ancient volcanic action,
which has thrown its trap-rocks into high precipices around its
northern shores and some of its islands, and lifted up vast ranges
of sandstone rocks into a vertical position, as is seen at the base
of the Porcupine Mountains. Its latest action appears to have
been in its western portion, as is proved by the upheaval of the
horizontal strata; and it may be inferred that its bed is very
rough and unequal.</p>

<p>The western termination of the lake, in the great bay of Fond
du Lac, denotes a double or masked shore, which appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
been formed of pebbles and sands, driven up by the tempests, at
the distance of a mile or two, outside of the original shore. The
result is shown by an elongated piece of water, resembling a lake,
which receives at the north, the River St. Louis, and the <i>Agoche</i>,
or Lefthand River, at its south extremity.</p>

<p>About three miles above the mouth of the river, we landed at
a Chippewa village. While exchanging the usual salutations
with them, we noticed the children of an African, who had intermarried
with this tribe. These children were the third in descent
from Bongo, a freed man of a former British commanding officer
at the Island of Michilimackinac. They possessed as black skins
as the father, a fact which may be accounted for by observing,
what I afterwards learned, that the marriages were, in the case of
the grandfather and father, with the pure Indian, and not with
Africano-Algonquin blood; so that there had been no direct advance
in the genealogical line.</p>

<p>The St. Louis River discharges a large volume of water, and
is destined hereafter to be a port of entry for the lake shipping,
but at present it has shoals of sand at its mouth which would
bar the entrance of large vessels. Proceeding up the river, we
found it very serpentine, and abounding in aquatic plants, portions
of it yielding the wild rice. At the computed distance of
twenty-four miles, we reached the establishment of the American
Fur Company. It was seven o'clock when we came to the place,
where we encamped.</p>

<p>Lake Superior is called by the Chippewas a sea.</p>

<p>The superficial area of the lake has been computed by Mr.
Darby at a little under nine hundred billions of feet, and its depth
at nine hundred feet. By the latest surveys and estimate, the
altitude of Lake Superior above tide water, is about six hundred
and forty feet.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[62]</a> Allowing Mr. Darby's computation to be correct,
this would sink its bed far below the surface of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>This lake has been the theatre of very extensive volcanic
action. Vast dykes of trap traverse its northern shores. One
of the principal of these has apparently extended across its bed,
from northeast to southwest, to the long peninsula of Keweena,
producing at the same time, the elevated range of the Okaug
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Mountains. One of the most remarkable features of these dykes
is the numerous and extensive veins of native copper which characterize
them. Subsequent convulsions, and the demolition of
these ancient dykes, by storms and tempests, have scattered along
its shores abundant evidence of the metal and its ores and veinstones,
which have attracted notice from the earliest time. The
geology of its southern coasts may be glanced at, and inferred,
from the subjoined outlines.</p>

<p>The teachings of topography, applied to commerce, are wonderful.
A longitudinal line, dropped south, from this point, would
cross the Mississippi at the foot of Lake Pepin, and pass through
Jefferson city on the Missouri. When, therefore, a ship canal
shall be made at St. Mary's Falls, vessels of large tonnage may
sail from Oswego (by the Welland canal) and Buffalo, through a
line of inter-oceanic seas, nearer to the foot of the Rocky Mountains,
by several hundred miles, than by any other possible route.
A railroad line from Fond du Lac west to the Columbia valley,
would also form the shortest and most direct transit route from
the Pacific to New York. Such a road would have the advantage
of passing through a region favorable to agriculture, which cannot
but develop abundant resources.</p>

<p>We had now reached above nine hundred and fifty miles from
our starting-point at Detroit, and had been more than forty days
in traversing the shores of Lakes Huron and Superior. July had
already commenced, and no time was to be lost in reaching our
extreme point of destination. Every exertion was therefore made
to push ahead. By ten o'clock of the morning after our arrival
at the Fond du Lac post, we embarked, and after going two miles
reached the foot of the first rapids of the St. Louis. This spot is
called the commencement of the Grand Portage&mdash;over this path
all the goods, provisions, and canoes are to be carried by hand
nine miles. During this distance, the St. Louis River, a stream
of prime magnitude, bursts through the high trap range of what
Bouchette calls the Cabotian Mountains, being a continuation of
the upheavals of the north shore of Lake Superior, the river
leaping and foaming, from crag to crag, in a manner which creates
some of the most grand and picturesque views. We sometimes
stood gazing at their precipices and falls, with admiration, and
often heard their roar on our path, when we were miles away
from them. Capt. Douglass estimated the river to fall one hundred
and eight feet during the first nine miles; and from estimates
furnished me by Dr. Wolcott, the aggregate fall from
the mouth of the Savannè, to that point, is two hundred and
twelve feet. We found the first part of the ascent of its banks
very precipitous and difficult, particularly for the men who bore
burdens, and what rendered the labor almost insupportable was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the heat, which stood at 82°, in the shade, at noon. We made
but five <i>pauses</i> the first day; and were three days on the portage.
It rained the second day, which added much to the difficulty of
our progress. We now found ourselves, at every step, advancing
into a wild and rugged region. Everything around us wore the
aspect of remoteness. Dark forests, swampy grounds, rocky precipices,
and the distant roaring of the river, as it leapt from rock
to rock, would have sufficiently impressed the mind with the
presence of the wilderness, without heavy rains, miry paths, and
the train of wild and picturesque Indians, who constituted a part
of our carriers.</p>

<p>The rocks, at the foot of the portage, consisted of horizontal
red sandstone. On reaching the head of it, we found argillite in
a vertical position. I found the latter, in some places, pervaded
by thin veins of quartz, and in one instance by grauwackke. At
one spot there was a small vein of coarse graphite in the argillite.
Large blocks of black crystallized hornblende rock lie along the
shores, where we again reached the river, and are often seen on
its bed, amid the swift-running water, but I did not observe this
rock in place. Among the loose stones at the foot of the portage,
I picked up a specimen of micaceous oxide of iron. Such are
the gleams of its geology and mineralogy. The growth of the
forest is pines, hemlock, spruce, birch, oak, and maple. In favorable
situations, I observed the common red raspberry, ripe.</p>

<p>On embarking above the portage, the expedition occupied seven
canoes, of a size most suitable for this species of navigation. Our
Indian auxiliaries from Fond du Lac were here rewarded, and
dismissed. On ascending six miles, we reached the Portage aux
Coteaux, so called from the carrying path lying over a surface
of vertical argillite. This rock, standing up in the bed, or on
the banks of the stream, with a scanty overhanging foliage of
cedar, gives a peculiarly wild and abrupt aspect to the scene;
which is by no means lessened by the loud roaring of the waters.
There is a fall and rapid at this portage, where the river, it may
be estimated, sinks its level about fourteen feet.</p>

<p>We encamped at the head of this portage, where the water
again permits the canoes to be put in. Thus far, we had found
this stream a broad, flowing torrent, but owing to its rapids and
rocks, anything but favorable to its navigation by boats, or canoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of heavy burden. His excellency Gov. Cass, therefore, determined
to relieve the river party, by detaching a sub-expedition across
the country to Sandy Lake. It was thought proper that I should
accompany this party. It consisted, besides, of Lieut. Mackay,
with eight soldiers, and of Mr. Doty, Mr. Trowbridge, and Mr.
Chase. We were provided with an interpreter and two Chippewa
guides, being sixteen persons in all.</p>

<p>Thus organized, we left the camp at the head of the portage,
the following morning, at six o'clock. Each one carried provisions
for five days, a knife, a musquito bar, and a blanket or
cloak. There were a few guns taken, but generally this was
thought to be an incumbrance, as we expected to see little game
and to encounter a toilsome tramp. The guides, taking their
course by the sun, struck west into a close forest of pine, hemlock,
and underbrush, which required energy to push through.
On travelling a couple of miles, we fell into an Indian path leading
in the required direction; but this path, after passing through
two ponds, and some marshes, eventually lost itself in swamps.
These marshes, after following through them, about four miles,
were succeeded by an elevated dry sandy barren, with occasional
clumps of pitch pine, and with a surface of shrubbery. Walking
over this dry tract was quite a relief. We then entered a thick
forest of young spruce and hemlock. Two miles of this brought
us to the banks of a small lake, with clear water, and a pebbly
shore. Having no canoe to cross it, our guides led us around its
southern shores. The fallen timber and brush rendered this a
very difficult march. To avoid these obstructions, as they approached
the head of the lake, we eventually took its margin,
occasionally leading into the water. While passing these shores,
I picked up some specimens of the water-worn agates, for which
the diluvians in this quarter are remarkable. We now fell into
an old Indian path, which led to two small lakes, similar in size,
to the former one, but with marshy borders, and reddish water.
These small lakes were filled with pond lilies, rushes, and wild
rice. At the margin of the second lake, the path ceased, and the
guides could not afterwards find it. The path terminated abruptly
at the second lake. While searching about this, Chamees,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[63]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>one of the Indian guides, found a large green tortoise, which he
and his companion killed in a very ingenious and effectual way,
by a blow from a hatchet on the neck, at the point where the
shell or buckler terminates. After leaving this water, they appeared
to be in doubt about the way; almost imperceptibly, we
found ourselves in a great tamarak swamp. The bogs and
moss served to cover up, almost completely, the fallen trees,
and formed so elastic a carpet as to sink deep at every tread.
Occasionally they broke through, letting the foot into the mire.
This proved a very fatiguing tramp. To add to its toils, it
rained at intervals all day. We were eleven hours in passing
this swamp, and estimated, and probably over-estimated ourselves
to have past twenty miles. We encamped at five o'clock near
the shores of a third small lake, each one picking out for himself
the most elevated spot possible, and the person who got a position
most completely out of the water was the best man. It is fatigue,
however, that makes sleep a welcome guest, and we awoke without
any cause of complaint on that score.</p>

<p>The next morning, as we were about to depart, we observed
near the camp-fire of our guides a pole leaning in the direction
we were to go, with a birch-bark inscription inserted in a slit in
the top of the pole. This was too curious an object not to excite
marked attention, and we took it down to examine the hieroglyphics,
or symbols, which had been inscribed with charcoal
on the birch scroll. We found the party minutely depicted by
symbols. The figures of eight muskets denoted that there were
eight soldiers in the party. The usual figure for a man, namely,
a closed cross with a head, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-113.jpg" width="75" height="97" alt="" /></div>

<p>and one hand holding a sword, told the tale that they were commanded
by an officer. Mr. Doty was drawn with a book, they
having understood that he was a lawyer. I was depicted with a
hammer, to denote a mineralogist. Mr. Trowbridge and Mr.
Chase, and the interpreter, were also depicted. Chamees and his
companion were drawn by a camp-fire apart, and the figure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the tortoise and a prairie-hen denoted the day's hunt. There
were three hacks on the pole, which leaned to the N. W., denoting
our course of travel. Having examined this unique memorial, it
was carefully replaced in its former position, when we again set
forward. It appeared we had rested in a sort of oasis in the
swamp, for we soon entered into a section of a decidedly worse
character than that we had passed the day before. The windfalls
and decaying timber were more frequent&mdash;the bogs, if possible,
more elastic&mdash;the spots dry enough to halt on, more infrequent,
and the water more highly colored with infusions of decaying
vegetable matter. We urged our way across this tract of morass
for nine hours, during which we estimated our progress at fourteen
miles, and encamped about four o'clock P. M., in a complete
state of exhaustion. Even our Indian guides demanded a halt;
and what had, indeed, added to our discouragements, was the uncertainty
of their way, which they had manifested.</p>

<p>Our second night's repose in this swampy tract, was on ground
just elevated above the water; the mosquitos were so pertinacious
at this spot as to leave us but little rest. From information
given by our guides, this wide tract of morass constitutes the
sources of the Akeek Seebi, or Kettle River, which is one of the
remotest sources of the Mille Lac, and, through that body of water,
of Rum River. It is visited only by the Indians, at the proper
season for trapping the beaver, marten, and muskrat. During
our transit through it, we came to open spaces where the cranberry
was abundant. In the same locality, we found the ripe
fruit, green berries, and blossoms of this fruit.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock A. M. when we resumed our march through
this toilsome tract, and we passed out of it, after pressing forward
with our best might, during twelve hours. We had been observant
of the perplexity of our guides, who had unwittingly, we
thought, plunged us into this dreary and seemingly endless morass,
and were rejoiced, on a sudden, to hear them raise loud
shouts. They had reached a part of the country known to them,
and took this mode to express their joy, and we soon found ourselves
on the banks of a small clear stream, called by them
Bezhiki Seebi, or Buffalo Creek, a tributary to Sandy Lake.
We had, at length, reached waters flowing into the Mississippi.
On this stream we prepared to encamp, in high spirits, feeling, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
those are apt to who have long labored at an object, a pleasure
in some measure proportioned to the exertions made.</p>

<p>Any other people but the Indians would feel ill at ease in
dreary regions like these. But these sons of the forest appear to
carry all their socialities with them, even in the most forbidding
solitudes. They are so familiarized with the notions of demons
and spirits, that the wildest solitude is replete with objects of
hope and fear. We had evidence of this, just before we encamped
on the banks of the Bezhiki, when we came to a cleared
spot, which had been occupied by what the Canadians, with much
force, call a <i>jonglery</i>, or place of necromantic ceremonies of their
priests or jossakeeds. There were left standing of this structure
six or eight smooth posts of equal length, standing perpendicularly.
These had been carefully peeled, and painted with a species
of ochrey clay. The curtains of bark, extending between
them, and isolating the powow, or operator, had been removed;
but the precincts had the appearance of having been carefully
cleared of brush, and the ground levelled, for the purposes of
these sacred orgies, which exercise so much influence on Indian
society.</p>

<p>We were awaked in our encampment, between four and five
o'clock, the next morning, by a shower of rain. Jumping up,
and taking our customary meal of jerked beef and biscuit, we
now followed our guides, with alacrity, over a dry and uneven
surface, towards Sandy Lake. We had now been three days in
accomplishing the traverse over this broad and elevated, yet
sphagnous summit, separating the valley of the St. Louis of Lake
Superior from that of the Upper Mississippi. As we approached
the basin of Sandy Lake, we passed over several sandy ridges,
bearing the white and yellow pine; the surface and its depressions
bearing the wild cherry, poplar, hazel, ledum latifolia, and
other usual growth and shrubs of the latitude. On the dry sandy
tracts the uva ursi, or kinnikinnik of the Indians, was noticed.
In the mineral constitution of the ridges themselves, the geologist
recognizes that wide-spreading drift-stratum, with boulders and
pebbles of sienitic and hornblende, quartz, and sandstone rock,
which is so prevalent in the region. As we approached the lake
we ascended one of those sandy ridges which surround it, and
dashing our way through the dense underbrush, were gratified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
on gaining its apex to behold the sylvan shores and islands of
the lake, with the trading-post and flag, seen dimly in the distance.
The view is preserved in the following outlines, taken on the spot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-116.jpg" class="border" width="497" height="269" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Sandy Lake, from an eminence north of the mouth of the West Creek of the
Portage of Savannah. 15th July, 1820.</p>

<p>I asked Chamees the Indian name of this lake. He replied,
Ka-metong-aug-e-maug. This is one of those compound terms,
in their languages, of which the particle <i>ka</i> is affirmative. Metongaug,
is the plural form of sandy lake. Maug is the plural
form of water, corresponding, by the usual grammatical duality
of meaning, to the plural form of the noun. The word might,
perhaps, be adopted in the form of Kametonga.</p>

<p>Having heard, on our passage through Lake Superior, that a
gun fired in the basin of Sandy Lake, could be heard at the fort,
that experiment was tried, while we sat down or sauntered about
to await the result. Having waited in vain, the shots were repeated.
After the lapse of a long time, a boat, with two men,
was descried in the distance approaching. It proved to be occupied
by two young clerks of the trading establishment, named
Ashmun and Fairbanks. They managed to embark the elite of
our party, in their small vessel, and, as we crossed the lake,
amused us with an account of the excitement our shots had
caused. Some Indian women affirmed to them that they had
heard warwhoops, and to make sure that a Sioux war party
were not upon them, they drove off their cattle to a place of
safety. In the actual position of affairs, the hunt being over for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the year, and the avails being sent to Michilimackinac (for this
was the head-quarters of the factor whom we had met at Shelldrake
River), the probabilities of its being a hunting party were
less. We informed them that we were an advance party of an
expedition sent out to explore the sources of the Mississippi
River, under the personal order of his Excellency Governor Cass,
who was urging his way up the St. Louis to the Savanna Portage,
through which he intended to descend into Sandy Lake.</p>

<p>It was near sunset before we landed at the establishment. We
found the trading fort a stockade of squared pine timber, thirteen
feet high, and facing an area a hundred feet square, with bastions
pierced for musketry at the southeast and northwest angles.
There were three or four acres outside of one of the angles, picketed
in, and devoted to the culture of potatoes. The stockade
inclosed two ranges of buildings. This is the post visited by
Lieut. Z. Pike, U. S. A., on snow-shoes, and with dog-trains, in
the winter of 1806, when it was occupied by the British northwest
trading company. As a deep mantle of snow covered the
country, it did not permit minute observations on the topography
or natural history; and there have been no explorations since.
Pike's chief error was in placing the source of the Mississippi in
Turtle Lake&mdash;a mistake which is due entirely, it is believed, to
the imperfect or false maps furnished him by the chief traders
of the time.</p>

<p>We were received with all the hospitality possible, in the actual
state of things, and with every kindness; and for the first time,
since leaving Detroit, we slept in a house. We were informed
that we were now within two miles of the Mississippi River, into
which the outlet of Sandy Lake emptied itself, and that we were
five hundred miles above the Falls of St. Anthony. We had
accomplished the transference of position from the head of the
basin of Lake Superior, that is, from the foot of the falls of the
St. Louis River, in seven days, by a route, too, certainly one of
the worst imaginable, and there can be no temerity in supposing
that it might be effected in light canoes in half that time.</p>

<p class="hanging indent">Reunion of the expedition on the Savanna Portage&mdash;Elevation of this summit&mdash;Descent
to Sandy Lake&mdash;Council with the Chippewa tribe&mdash;Who are they?&mdash;Traits
of their history, language, and customs&mdash;Enter the Mississippi, with a

<p>On rising on the next morning (14th July), our minds were
firmly set, at the earliest moment, to rejoin the main expedition,
which had been toiling its way up the St. Louis River to the
Savanna Portage. And as soon as we had dispatched our breakfast
at the Post, we set out, accompanied by one of the trading
clerks, for that noted carrying place between the waters of the
St. Louis and Sandy Lake. We reached its northwestern terminus
at about twelve o'clock, and were surprised to find Gov. Cass,
with some of his party, and a part of the baggage, already there;
and by five o'clock in the afternoon the last of the latter, together
with the canoes, arrived. And it was then, in the exhausted state
of the men, and at so late an hour, concluded to encamp, and
await the morning to commence the descent of the west Savannè
to the lake.</p>

<p>The expedition had, after we left them at the Portage aux
Coteaux on the 10th, and being thus relieved of our weight,
urged its way up the river, with labor, about fifty-six miles, to
the inlet of the east Savannè, having surmounted, in this distance,
rapids of the aggregate estimated height of two hundred and
twelve feet, which occupied two days. They then ascended the
Savannè twenty-four miles, rising eighteen feet. The portage,
from water to water, is six miles. It commences in a tamarak
swamp, from which the bog, in a dry season, has been burnt off,
leaving the path a mass of mire. Trees and sticks have, from
time to time, been laid in this to walk on, which it requires the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
skill of a balancing master to keep. For the distance of three
<i>pozes</i> [pauses] this is the condition of the path; afterwards, the
footing becomes dry, and there are ascending sand ridges, which
are easily crossed.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolcott, to whom I had handed my geological note-book,
made the following observations. "We left the vertical strata
of slate, about two miles above the Portage aux Coteaux. They
were succeeded by rocks of hornblende, which continued the
whole distance to the head of the Grand Rapid. These rocks
were only to be observed in the bed of the river, and appeared
to be much water-worn, and manifestly out of place. Soon after
we left the Portage aux Coteaux, the hills receded from the river,
and its banks for the rest of the way were generally low, often
alluvial, and always covered with a thick growth of birch, elm,
sugar-tree (acer saccharinum), and the whole tribe of pines, with
an almost impenetrable thicket of underbrush.</p>

<p>"The appearances of this day (11th) have been similar to those
of yesterday, except that the country bordering the river became
entirely alluvial, and the poplar became the predominating growth,
while the evergreen almost entirely disappeared. The rocks were
seldom visible, except upon the rapids, and then only in the bed
of the river, and were entirely composed of hornblende, all out
of place, and exhibiting no signs of stratification, but evidently
thrown confusedly together by the force of the current.</p>

<p>"The Savannè River is about twenty yards broad at its junction
with the St. Louis, but soon narrows to about half the breadth,
which it retains until it forks at the distance of about twelve
miles from its mouth. Its whole course runs through a low
marshy meadow, the timbered land occasionally reaching to the
banks of the river, but generally keeping a distance of about
twenty rods on either side. The meadow is, for the most part,
covered with tufts of willow and other shrubs, common to marshes.
The woods, which skirt it, are of the same kinds observed on the
preceding days, except that a species of small oak frequently
appears among it. The river becomes so narrow towards its
head, that it is with great difficulty canoes can make their way
through its windings; and the portage commences a mile or two
from its source, which is in a tamarak swamp."</p>

<p>The height of land between the east and west Savannè, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Wolcott estimates at about thirty feet. Adding to this elevation
the estimates of Capt. Douglass, before mentioned, the entire elevation
between the foot of the falls of the St. Louis and the apex
of this summit is three hundred and sixty-eight feet.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[64]</a></p>

<p>Having exchanged congratulations, and recited to each other
the little personal incidents which had marked our respective
tracks of entry into the country, we passed the night on the
sources of this little stream; and the next morning, at five o'clock,
began its descent. It is a mere brook, only deep enough, at this
spot, to embark the canoes, and two men to manage them. At
the distances of four, and of twelve miles, there are rapids, where
half the loads are carried over portages. At the foot of the latter
rapid, there is a tributary called Ox Creek, and from this point to
the lake, a distance of six miles, the navigation is practicable with
full loads. We entered the lake with pleasurable feelings, at the
accomplishment of our transit over this summit, and after a
passage of three miles over the calm and sylvan surface of the
lake, the expedition reached and landed at the company's fort.
It was now four o'clock in the afternoon of a most serene day,
and the Indians, who were gathered on the shores, received us
with a salute <i>a la mode de savage</i>, that is, with balls fired over our
heads. Quarters were provided in the fort for such as did not
prefer to lodge in tents. Understanding that there was to be a
day's rest at this post, to reorganize the party, and hold intercourse
with the Indians, each one prepared to make such use of
his time as best subserved his purposes. Finding my baggage
had been wetted and damaged on the portages in the ascent of
the St. Louis, I separated the moulded and ruined from things
still worth saving, and drying the latter in the sun, prepared them
for further use.</p>

<p>On the day after our arrival (16th) a council of the Indians&mdash;the
Chippewas&mdash;was convened. The principal chiefs were Kadewabedas,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[65]</a>
or Broken Teeth, and Babisekundeba,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[66]</a> or the Curly Head.
This tribe, it appears, are conquerors in the country, having at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>an early, or ante-historical age, advanced from Lake Superior,
driving back the Sioux. The war between these two tribes is
known to have existed since the first entry of the French into
the country&mdash;then a part of New France&mdash;early in the seventeenth
century. Gov. Cass proposed to them to enter into a firm peace
with the Sioux, and to send a delegation with him to St. Peter's,
on his return from the sources of the Mississippi. To this they
assented. Speeches were made by the Indians, which it is not
my purpose to record, as they embraced nothing beyond the ordinary,
every-day style of the native speakers.</p>

<p>It was determined to encamp the heavy part of the expedition
at this place, and to organize a sub-expedition of two light canoes,
well manned, to explore the sources of the Mississippi River.
While these arrangements are in progress, it may be proper to
state something more respecting the condition and history of the
Chippewa nation. And first, they are Algonquins, having migrated,
at ante-Cartierian<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[67]</a> periods, from the vicinity of Lake
Nippesing, on the Outawis summit. Anterior to this, their own
traditions place them further eastward, and their language bears
evidence that the stock from which they are sprung, occupied the
Atlantic from the Chesapeake, extending through New England.
The name Chippewa is derived from the term Ojibwa. The latter
has been variously, but not satisfactorily derived. The particle
<i>bwa</i>, in the language, signifies voice. They are a well-formed,
active race of men, and have the reputation of being good hunters
and warriors. They possess the ordinary black shining eyes,
black straight hair, and general physiological traits of the Indian
race; and do not differ, essentially, from the northern tribes in
their manners and customs. Pike, who was the first American
officer to visit them, in this region, estimates the whole number
seated on the Upper Mississippi, and northwest of Lake Superior,
in the year 1806, at eleven thousand one hundred and seventy-seven.
This estimate includes the entire population, extending
south to the St. Croix and Chippewa valleys, below St. Anthony's
Falls. It is believed to be much too high, for which it can be
plead in extenuation, that it was the rough estimate of foreign
traders, who were interested in exalting their importance to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>United States. Certain it is, there are not more than half the
numbers, in this region, at present. The number which he
assigns to the Sandy Lake band is three hundred and forty-five.</p>

<p>The Chippewas of the Upper Mississippi are, in fact, the advanced
band of the widespread Algonquin family, who, after
spreading along the Atlantic from Virginia, as far as the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, have followed up the great chain of lakes, to this
region, leaving tribes of more or less variation of language on the
way. There may have been a thousand years, or more, expended
on this ethnological track, and the names by which they were, at
various ages and places, known, are only important as being derivatives
from a generic stock of languages whose radicals are
readily recognized. Furthest removed, in the line of migration,
appear the Mohicans, Lenno Lenawpees, Susquehannocks, and
Powatans, and their congeners. The tribes of this continent
appear, indeed, to have been impelled in circles, resembling the
whirlwinds which have swept over its surface; and, so far as
relates to the mental power which set them in motion, the comparison
also holds good, for the effects of their migrations appear,
everywhere, to have been war and destruction. One age appears
to produce no wiser men than another. Having no mode of
recording knowledge, experience dies with the generation who
felt it, all except the doubtful and imprecise data of tradition;
and this is little to be trusted, after a century or two. For the
matter of exact history, they might as well trace themselves to
the moon, as some of their mythological stories do, as to any other
planet, or part of a planet. Of their language, the only certainly
reliable thing in their history, a vocabulary is given in the Appendix.
To the ear, it appears flowing and agreeable, and
not of difficult utterance; and there is abundant reason, on beholding
how readily they express themselves, for the plaudits
which the early French writers bestowed on the Algonquin
language.</p>

<p>We observed the custom of these Indians of placing their dead
on scaffolds. The corpse is carefully wrapped in bark, and then
elevated on a platform made by placing transverse pieces in forks
of trees, or on posts, firmly set in the ground. This custom is
said to have been borrowed by the Chippewas, of this quarter,
from the Dacotahs or Sioux. When they bury in the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
which is the general custom, a roof of bark is put over the deceased.
This inclosure has an aperture cut in it at the head,
through which a dish of food is set for the dead. Oblations of
liquor are also sometimes made. This ancient custom of offering
food and oblations to the dead, reminds the reader of similar
customs among some of the barbarous tribes of the oriental world.
We noticed also symbolic devices similar to those seen at Huron
River or Lake Superior, inscribed on posts set at the head of
Indian graves. It seems to be the prime object of these inscriptions
to reveal the family name, or <i>totem</i>, as it is called, of the
deceased, together with devices denoting the number of times he
has been in battle, and the number of scalps he has taken. As
this test of bravery is the prime object of an Indian's life, the
greatest efforts are made to attain it.</p>

<p>A word may be said as to the climate and soil of this region,
and their adaptation to the purposes of agriculture. By the
tables of temperature annexed (<i>vide</i> Appendix), the mean solar
heat, in the shade, during the time of our being in the country,
is shown to be 67°. It is evident that it is the idle habits of the
Indians, and no adverse circumstances of climate or soil, that
prevent their raising crops for their subsistence.</p>

<p>Arrangements for a light party to ascend the Mississippi, and
seek for its sources, having been made, we left Sandy Lake, in
two canoes, at nine o'clock in the morning on the 17th. This
party, in addition to his Excellency Gov. Cass, consisted of Dr.
Alex. Wolcott, Capt. Douglass, Lieut. Mackay, Maj. Forsyth, and
myself, with nineteen voyageurs and Indians, provisioned for
twelve days. A voyage of about a mile across the western prolongation
of the lake, brought us to its outlet&mdash;a wide winding
stream, with a very perceptible current, and rich alluvial banks,
bearing a forest. After pursuing it some mile and a half, we
descended a small rapid, where the average descent of water in a
short distance may be perhaps three feet; it appeared, however,
to give the men no concern, for they urged their way down it,
with full strength of paddle and song, and we soon found ourselves
in the Mississippi. The first sight of this stream reminded
me of one of its striking characteristics, at far lower points,
namely, its rapidity. Its waters are slightly turbid, with a reddish
tint. Its width, at this point, as denoted by admeasurements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
subsequently made,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[68]</a> is three hundred and thirty-one feet. Its
banks are alluvial and of a fertile aspect, bearing a forest of oaks,
maples, elms, ash, and pines, with a dense undergrowth of shrubbery.
I observed a species of polyganum in the water's edge,
and wherever we attempted to land it was miry and the borders
wet and damp. We were now, from our notes, a hundred and
forty-seven miles due west of the head of Lake Superior, by the
curved lines of travelling, and probably one hundred in an air
line; and had struck the channel of the Mississippi, not less, by
the estimates, than two thousand five hundred miles above its
mouth on the Gulf of Mexico. It could not, from the very vague
accounts we could obtain from the traders, originate, at the utmost,
more than three hundred miles higher, and our Canadian voyageurs
turned up the stream, with that Troubadour air, or <i>gaite de cour</i>,
keeping time with song and paddle, with which New France had
at first been traversed by its Champlains, Marquettes, and Frontenacs.
To conquer distance and labor, at the same time, with a
song, has occurred to no other people, and if these men are not
happy, in these voyages, they, at least, have the semblance of it,
and are merry. To keep up this flow of spirits, and bravery of
capacity in demolishing distances, they always overrate the per
diem travel, which, as I have before observed, is put about one-third
too high&mdash;that is to say, their league is about two miles.
On we went, at this rapid rate, stopping every half hour to rest
five minutes. During this brief rest, their big kettle of boiled
corn and pork was occasionally brought forward, and dipped in,
with great fervency of spoon; but, whether eating or working,
they were always gay, and most completely relieved from any
care of what might happen to-morrow. For the mess kettle was
ever most amply supplied, and not according to the scanty pattern
which these couriers de bois often encounter in the Indian trade
on these summits, when they are sometimes reduced to dine on
tripe de Roche and sup on buton de rose; but they bore in mind
that their employer, namely, Uncle Sam, was a full-handed man,
and they kept up a most commendable mental balance, by at once
eating strong and working strong.</p>

<p>During the first twenty-seven miles, above the inlet of Sandy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>Lake, we passed six small rapids, at distances of three, four, three,
one, five, and eleven miles, where the river sinks its level twenty-nine
feet, in the estimated aggregate distance of seven hundred
yards.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[69]</a> Above the latter, extending twenty miles, to the point
of our encampment, there is no perceptible rapid. It was eight
o'clock when we encamped, having been eleven hours in our
canoes, without stretching our legs, and we had ascended forty-six
miles.</p>

<p>Our encampment was near the mouth of Swan River, a considerable
stream, originating in Swan Lake, near the head of the
St. Louis River of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>We had been pushing our way, daily, up to our arrival at
Sandy Lake; but the word, from leaving that point, was, emphatically,
push&mdash;and we can hardly be said to have taken proper
time to eat or sleep. There was a shower of rain, during the
night; it ceased at four o'clock, and we again embarked at five,
in a cloudy and misty morning, and it continued cloudy all day.
The current of the Mississippi continues to be strong; its velocity,
during the ascent of this day, was computed by Capt.
Douglass at two and a half miles per hour. We passed a rapid
about six miles below Trout River, where there is a computed
descent of three feet in a hundred and fifty yards. A few miles
before reaching Trout River, we passed through a forest of dead
pines, occupying ridges of sand, through which the river has cut
its way. Four miles above the entrance of Trout River, we
passed the mouth of a considerable stream, called by the Chippewas
Mushkoda, or Prairie River, and encamped about five
hundred yards above its mouth on a high sandy elevation. It
was now eight o'clock P.M. We had ascended the river fifty-one
miles, having been fifteen hours in our canoes, and we here
first took our breakfast. This severity of fasting was, I think,
quite unintentional, the mess-basket being in the other canoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
which kept ahead of us the entire day. We had this day observed
specimens of the Unio and some other species of fresh-water shells
along the shore. And of birds, besides the duck, plover, and
loon, which frequent the water, we noticed the thrush, robin,
blackbird, and crow. The comparative coolness of the day rendered
the annoyance from mosquitos less severe than we had
found them the preceding day. The night on this sandy and
bleak elevation proved cool, with a heavy dew, which resulted in
a dense fog in the morning. We found ice on the bottoms of
the canoes, which are turned up at night, of the thickness of a
knife-blade.</p>

<p>Our third day's ascent witnessed no diminution of the strength
and alacrity with which our canoemen urged our way up the
stream. We were off betimes, in a lowering and dense atmosphere,
which obscured objects. After advancing some six miles,
there are a series of small rapids, which are, taken together, called
Ka-ka-bi-ka,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[70]</a> where I estimated the river to sink its level sixteen
feet, in a short distance; at none of these is the navigation, however,
impeded. The rock stratification appears too compact for
sand-rock, and is obscured by contiguous boulders, which are indicative
of the strong drift-formation, which has spread from the
north and east over this region. Four miles after ascending the
last of the Kakabika Rapids, we landed at the foot of the Pakagama
Falls. Here the lading was immediately put ashore, the
canoes landed, and the whole carried over an Indian portage path
of two hundred and seventy-five yards. This delay afforded an
opportunity to view the falls. The Mississippi, at this point,
forces its way through a formation of quartzy rock, during which
it sinks its level, as estimated, twenty feet, in a distance of about
three hundred yards. There is no perceptible cascade or abrupt
fall, but the river rushes with the utmost velocity down a highly
inclined rocky bed towards the northeast. It forms a complete
interruption to navigation, and must, hereafter, be the terminus
of the navigation of that class of small steamboats which may be
introduced above the Falls of St. Anthony. The general elevation
of the geological stratum at the top of this fall must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>but little under fourteen hundred feet above the Gulf of Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[71]</a>
This summit bears a growth of the yellow pine. I observed,
amongst the shrubs, the vaccinium dumosum. Immediately above
the falls is a small rocky island, bearing a growth of spruce and
cedars, being the first island noticed above Sandy Lake. This
island parts the channel into two, at the precise point of its precipitation.
On coming to the head of these falls, we appear to
have reached a vast geological plateau, consisting of horizontal
deposits of clay and drift on the nucleus of granitical and metamorphic
rocks, which underlie the sources of the Mississippi River.
The vast and irregular bodies of water called Leech Lake, Winnipek,
and Cass Lakes, together with a thousand lesser lakes of a
mile or two in circumference, lie on this great diluvial summit.
These lakes spread east and west over a surface of not less than
two hundred miles; most of them are connected with channels of
communication forming a tortuous and intricate system of waters,
only well known to the Indians; and there seems the less wonder
that the absolute and most remote source of the Mississippi has
so long remained a matter of doubt.</p>

<p>By the time we had well seen the falls, and made some sketches
and notes, the indefatigable canoemen announced our baggage all
carried over the portage, and the canoes put into the water. Embarking,
at this point, we found the river had lost its velocity; it
was often difficult to determine that it had any current at all.
We wound about, by a most tortuous channel, through savannas
where coarse species of grass, flags, reeds, and wild rice struggled
for the mastery. The whole country appeared to be one flat
surface, where the sameness of the objects, the heat of the weather,
and the excessively serpentine channel of the river, conspired to
render the way tedious. The banks of the river were but just
elevated above these illimitable fields of grass and aquatic plants.
In these banks the gulls had their nests, and as they were disturbed
they uttered deafening screams. Water-fowl were intruded
upon at every turn, the blackbird and rail chattered over their
clusters of reeds and cat-tails; the falcon screamed on high, as he
quietly sailed above our heads, and the whole feathered creation
appeared to be decidedly intruded on by our unwonted advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>into the great watery plateau, to say nothing of the small and
unimportant class of reptiles who inhabit the region.</p>

<p>Forty miles above the falls, the River Vermilion flows in
through these savannas on the left hand; and three miles higher
the Deer River is tributary on the right hand. We ascended six
miles above the latter, and encamped in a dry prairie, on the
same side, at a late hour. The men reported themselves to have
travelled sixteen leagues, notwithstanding their detention on the
Pakagama Portage. How far we had advanced, in a direct line,
is very questionable. At one spot, we estimated ourselves to
have passed, by the river's involutions, nine miles, but to have
advanced directly but one mile. I noticed, on the meadow at
this spot, a small and very delicious species of raspberry, the
plant not rising higher than three or four inches. This species,
of which I preserved both the roots and fruit, I referred to
Dr. J. Torrey, of New York, who pronounced it the Rebus Nutkanus
of Moçino&mdash;a species found by this observer in the Oregon
regions. It is now known to occur eastwardly, to upper Michigan.
As night approached on these elevated prairies, we observed for
the first time the fire-fly.</p>

<p>The next morning (20th) we were again in motion at half-past
five o'clock. It had rained during the night, and the morning
was cloudy, with a dense fog. At the distance of ten miles, we
passed the Leech Lake River. This is a very considerable river,
bringing in, apparently, one-third as much water as the main
branch. It is, however, but fifty miles in length, and is merely
the outlet of the large lake bearing that name. It was thought
the current of the Mississippi denoted greater velocity above this
point, while the water exhibited greater clearness. We had still
the same savanna regions, with a serpentine channel to encounter.
Through this the men urged their way for a distance of thirty-five
miles, when Winnipek Lake displayed itself before us. The
waters of this lake have a whitish, slightly turbid aspect, after the
prevalence of storms, which appears to reveal its shallowness,
with a probably whitish clay bottom. The Chippewa name of
Winnebeegogish<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[72]</a> is, indeed, derivative from this circumstance.
This lake is stated to be ten miles in its greatest length. We
crossed it transversely in order to strike the inlet of the Mississippi,
and encamped on the other side. In this transit we met a
couple of Indian women in a canoe, who, being interrogated by
the interpreter, stated that they came to observe whether the wild
rice, which is quite an item of the Indian subsistence in this
quarter, was matured enough to be tied into clusters for beating
out. We estimated our advance this day, by the time denoted
by the chronometer, at fifty-one miles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>We were again in our canoes the next morning at half-past
four o'clock. In coasting along the north shores of Winnipek
Lake, an object of limy whiteness attracted our attention, which
turned out to be a small island composed of granitical and other
boulders, which had served as the resting-place of birds, for which
the region above the Pakagama Falls is so remarkable. On landing,
a dead pelican was stretched on the surface. We had not
before observed this species on the river, and named the island
Shayta, from its Chippewa name. The buzzard, cormorant, brant,
eagle, and raven had hitherto constituted the largest species.
Along the shores of the river, the king-fisher and heron had been
frequent objects. With respect to the cormorant, it was observed
that the Indians classify it with the species of duck, their name
for it, ka-ga-ge-sheeb, signifying, literally, crow-duck.</p>

<p>On again reaching the inlet of the Mississippi, its size and appearance
corresponded so exactly to its character below the Winnipek,
that it had evidently experienced but little or no change
by passing through this lake. The same width and volume were
observed which it had below this point; the same moderate velocity;
the same borders of grassy savanna, and the same tendency
to redouble its length, by its contortions, appeared. In some
places, however, it approaches those extensive ridges of sandy
formation, bearing pines, which traverse, or rather bound, these
wide savannas. Through these channels the canoemen urged
their course with their usual alacrity&mdash;now stopping a few moments
to breathe, and then, striking their paddles again in the
water with renewed vigor, and often starting off with one of their
animated canoe-songs. From about eight o'clock in the morning
till two in the afternoon we proceeded up the winding thread of
this channel, when the appearance of a large body of water in the
distance before us attracted attention. It was the first glimpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
we had of the upper Red Cedar Lake. The Mississippi River
here deploys itself in one of those large sheets of pellucid water
which are so characteristic of its sources. On reaching the estuary
at its entrance, a short halt was made. A large body of the most
transparent water spread out before us. Its outlines, towards the
south, were only bounded by the line of the horizon. In the
distance appeared the traces of wooded islands. If Sandy Lake
had, on emerging from the wilderness, impressed us with its rural
beauty, this far transcended it in the variety and extent of outlines,
and that oceanic amplitude of freshness, which so often
inspires admiration in beholding the interior American lakes. It
was determined to cross a part of the lake towards the north-east,
in order to strike the site of an ancient Indian village at the
mouth of Turtle River; and under the influences of a serene day,
and one of their liveliest chants, the men pushed for that point,
which was reached at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st
July. The spot at which we landed was the verge of a green
lawn, rising in a short distance to a handsome eminence, crowned
with oaks and maples. One or two small log tenements stood on
this slope occupied by two Canadians in the service of the American
Fur Company. Several wigwams of bark and poles lifted
their fragile conical forms on either side.</p>

<p>In one of these tenements, consisting of a small cabin of poles,
sheathed with bark, we found an object of human misery which
excited our sympathies. It was in the person of one of the Canadians,
to whom reference has been made, of the name of Montruille.
He had, in the often severe peregrinations of the fur
trade in this quarter, been caught in a snow-storm during the last
winter, and frozen both his feet in so severe a manner that they
eventually sloughed off, and he could no longer stand upright or
walk. He lay on the ground in a most pitiable state of dejection,
with the stumps of his legs bound up with deer skins, with a gray,
long-neglected beard, and an aspect of extreme despair. English he
could not speak; and the French he uttered was but an abuse of the
noble gift of language to call down denunciations on those who had
deserted him, or left him thus to his fate. A rush mat lay under
him. He had no covering. He was emaciated to the last degree,
every bone in his body seemed visible through the skin. His
cheeks were fallen in, and his eyes sunk in their sockets, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
darting a look of despair. His Indian wife had deserted him.
Food, of an inadequate quality, was occasionally thrown in to
him. Such were the accounts we received. Governor Cass directed
groceries, ammunition, and presents of clothing to be made
to him, to the latter of which, every member of the party added.
He also engaged a person to convey him to Sandy Lake.</p>

<p>We examined the environs of the place with interest; the
village occupies the north banks of Turtle River Valley. Turtle
River, which cuts its way through this slope and plain, constitutes
the direct line of intercourse for the Indian trade, through
Turtle and Red Lakes, to the Red River Valley of Hudson's Bay.
On inquiry, we learned that this river had constituted the ancient
Indian line of communication by canoes and portages, from time
immemorial, with that valley, the distance to the extreme plateau,
or summit, being about sixty miles. On this summit, within a
couple of miles of each other, lie Turtle and Red Lakes, the one
having its discharge into the Gulf of Mexico and the other into
Hudson's Bay. When Canada was settled by the French, this
aboriginal route was adopted. The fur companies of Great Britain,
on coming into possession of the country, after the fall of
Quebec, 1759, followed the same route. The factors of these companies
told Lieutenant Pike, in 1806, at Sandy Lake and Leech
Lake, that the Turtle portage was the only practicable route of
communication to the Red River, and that it was the true source
of the Mississippi; and they furnished him manuscript maps of
the country conformable to these views. The region has actually
been in possession of the Americans only since 1806, adopting
the era of Pike's visit.</p>

<p>By inquiry from the Chippewa Indians at this village, sanctioned
by the Canadian authorities, we are informed that the Mississippi
falls into the south end of Cass Lake, at the distance of eight or
ten miles; that it reaches that point from the west, by a series of
sharp rapids stretching over an extent of about forty miles from
a large lake;<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[73]</a> and that this celebrated stream originates in Lac la
Biche, about six days' journey from our present position, and has
many small lakes, rapids, and falls. It is further asserted by the
Indians, that the water in these remote streams, and upon these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>rapids, is at all times shallow, but it is particularly so this season;
and that it is not practicable to reach these remote sources of the
river with boats, or large canoes of the size we have.</p>

<p>On submitting these facts to the gentlemen composing his party,
Governor Cass asked each one to give his views, beginning with
the youngest, and to express his opinion on the feasibility of
further explorations. They concurred in opinion that, in the
present low state of the water on these summits, considering the
impossibility of ascending them with our present craft, and in the
actual state of our provisions, such an attempt was impracticable.
Thereon, he announced his decision to rejoin our party at Sandy
Lake, and to pursue the exploration of the river down its channel
to the Falls of St. Anthony, to the inlet of the Wisconsin and
Fox Rivers, and to return into the great lake basins, and complete
their circumnavigation.</p>

<p>Having reached the ultimate geographical point visited by the
expedition, I thought it due to the energy and enlightened zeal
of the gentleman who had led us, to mark the event by naming
this body of water in my journal Cassina, or Cass Lake. There
was the more reason for this in the nomenclature of the geography
of the upper Mississippi, by observing that it embraces
another Red Cedar Lake. The latitude of upper Red Cedar, or
Cass Lake, is placed by Pike at 47° 42´40´´.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[74]</a> Its distance above
Sandy Lake, by the involutions of the river, is two hundred and
seventy miles, and from Fond du Lac, at the head of Lake Superior,
by the travelled route, four hundred and thirty miles. It
is situated seventeen degrees north of the Gulf of Mexico, from
which it is computed to be distant two thousand nine hundred
and seventy-eight geographical miles. Estimating the distance
to the actual origin of the river, as determined at a subsequent
period, at one hundred and eighty-two miles above Cass Lake, the
length of the Mississippi River is shown to be three thousand
one hundred and sixty miles,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[75]</a> making a direct line over the
earth's surface of more than half the distance from the arctic
circle to the equator. It may also be observed of the Mississippi,
that its sources lie in a region of snows and long-continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>winter, while it enters the ocean under the latitude of perpetual
verdure; and at last, as if disdaining to terminate its career at the
ordinary point of embouchure of other large rivers, has protruded
its banks into the Gulf of Mexico, more than a hundred
miles beyond any other part of the main. To have visited both
the source and the mouth of the stream has fallen to the lot of but
few, and I believe there is no person living beside myself of
whom the remark can be made. On the tenth of July, 1819, I
passed out of the mouth of the Mississippi in a brig bound for
New York, after descending it in a steamboat from St. Louis, but
little thinking I should soon visit its waters, yet, on the twenty-first
of July of the following year, I reached its sources in this
lake.</p>

<p>In deciding upon the physical character of the Mississippi
River, it may be advantageously considered under four natural
divisions, as indicated by permanent differences in its geological
and physical character&mdash;its vegetable productions, and its velocity
and general hydrographical character. Originating in a region
of lakes upon the table-lands which throw their waters north
into Hudson's Bay, south into the Gulf of Mexico, and east into
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it pursues its course south to the Falls
of Pakagama, a distance of two hundred and thirty miles, through
natural meadows or savannas covered with wild rice, rushes, reeds
and coarse grasses, and aquatic plants. During the distance, it is
extremely devious in its course and width, often expanding into
lakes which connect themselves through a vast system of reticulated
channels. Leech Lake, Cass Lake, and Lake Andrúsia
would themselves be regarded as small interior seas, were they
on any other part of the continent but that which develops Superior,
Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Its velocity through
the upper plateau is but little, and it affords every facility for the
breeding of water fowl and the small furred quadrupeds, the
favorite reliance of a nomadic population.</p>

<p>At the Falls of Pakagama, the first rock stratum and the first
wooded island is seen. Here the river has an aggregate fall of
twenty feet, and from this point to St. Anthony's Falls, a distance
of six hundred miles, it exhibits its second characteristic division.
The granitical and metamorphic rocks, which support the vast
plateaux and beds of draft of its sources, are only apparent above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
this point, in boulders. The permanent strata are but barely
concealed at several rapids below the Pakagama, but appear
plainly below the influx of the De Corbeau, at Elk River, Little
Falls, and near Sac River. And this system of rock is succeeded,
before reaching the Falls of St. Anthony, by the horizonal white
sand rock and its superior limestone series of the carboniferous
formation.</p>

<p>Vegetation is developed as the river descends towards the south.
A forest of maples, elm, oak, ash, and birch, is interspersed with
spruce, birch, poplar, and pine above the Pakagama, and continues,
in favorable positions, throughout this division. The black walnut
is first seen below Sandy Lake, and the sycamore below the River
De Corbeau. The river in this division has numerous well-wooded
islands; its velocity is a striking feature; it abounds
with rapids, none of which, however, oppose serious obstacles
to its navigation. Agreeably to memoranda kept,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[76]</a> it has fifty-six
distinct rapids, including the Little and Big Falls, in all of
which the river has an aggregate estimated descent of two hundred
and twenty-four feet, within a distance of fourteen thousand
six hundred and forty yards, or about eight miles. The mean
fall of the current, exclusive of these rapids, may be computed at
nearly six inches per mile.</p>

<p>The course of the river, below the Falls of Pakagama, is still
serpentine, but strikingly less so than above, and its bends are
not so short and abrupt. The general course of this river, till it
reaches the rock formation of Pakagama, is from the west.
Thence, to Sandy Lake inlet, it flows generally southeast; from
this point to the inlet of the De Corbeau or Crow Wing, it is
deflected to the southwest; thence almost due south, to the mouth
of the Watab River; and thence again southeast to the Falls of
St. Anthony. A geographical line dropped from the inlet of
Sandy Lake, where the channel is first deflected to the southwest,
to St. Anthony's Falls, or the mouth of the St. Peter's,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[77]</a> forms a

mean descent&mdash;Etymology of the name Mississippi&mdash;Descent of the river to Sandy
Lake, and thence to the Falls of St. Anthony&mdash;Recross the great Bitobi Savanna&mdash;Pakagama
formation&mdash;Description of the voyage from Sandy Lake to
Pine River&mdash;Brief notices of the natural history.</p>

<p>The third geographical division in which it is proposed to
consider the Mississippi, begins at the Falls of St. Anthony.
Within half a day's march, before reaching this point from its
sources, the primitive and crystallized, and the altered and basaltic
rocks are succeeded by the great limestone and sandstone
horizontal series of the carboniferous, magnesian, and metalliferous
rocks, which constitute by themselves so extraordinary a body of
geological phenomena. Entering on the level of the white sandstone
stratum, which is fundamental in this column, about the
inlet of Rum River, the Mississippi urges its way over a gently
inclining bed of this rock, to the brink of this cataract, where it
drops perpendicularly about sixteen feet; but the whole descent
of its level from the head to the foot of the portage path, cannot
be less than double that height.</p>

<p>The river, at this point, enters a valley which is defined by rocky
cliffs, which attain various elevations from one to three hundred
feet, presenting a succession of picturesque or sublime views. In
some places these cliffs present a precipitous and abrupt façade,
washed by the current. In far the greatest number of cases, the
eminence has lost its sharp angles through the effects of frosts,
rains, and elemental action, leaving a slope of debris at the foot.
As the river descends, it increases in volume and in the extent of
its alluvions. These form, in an especial manner, its characteristic
features from St. Anthony's Falls to the junction of the Missouri,
a distance of not less than eight hundred miles. The principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
tributaries which it receives in this distance, are, on the right, the
St. Peter's, Upper and Lower Iowa, Turkey River, Desmoines, and
Salt Rivers; and, on the left, the St. Croix, Chippewa, Wisconsin,
Rock River, and the Illinois. One hundred miles below St. Anthony,
it expands for a distance of twenty-four miles into the sylvan
sheet of Lake Pepin, at the foot of which it receives the large
volume of the Chippewa River, which originates on the sandy
tracts at the sources of the Wisconsin, Montreal, and Ontonagon;
and it is from this point that its continually widening channel
exhibits those innumerable and changing sand-bars, which so
embarrass the navigation. But in all this distance, it is only at
the Desmoines and Rock River rapids that any permanent serious
impediment is found in its navigation, with the larger craft.</p>

<p>The fourth change in the physical aspect of this river, is at the
junction of the Missouri, and this is an almost total and complete
one; for this river brings down such a vast and turbid flood of
commingled earths and floating matter, that it characterizes this
stream to its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico. If its length of
channel, velocity, and other leading phenomena had been accurately
known at an early day, it should also have carried its name
from this point to the ocean. Down to this point, the Mississippi,
at its summer phases, carries the character of a comparatively
clear stream. But the Missouri, which, from its great length and
remote latitude, has a summer freshet, flows in with a flood so
turbid and opaque, that it immediately communicates its qualities
and hue to the milder Mississippi. At certain seasons, the
struggle between the clear and turbid waters of the two streams
can be seen, at opposite sides of the river, at the distance of
twenty or thirty miles. Entire trees, sometimes ninety feet long,
with their giant arms, are swept down the current; and it is not
unusual, at its highest flood, to observe large, spongy masses of a
species of pseudo pumice carried into its channel, from some of its
higher western tributaries.</p>

<p>To such a moving, overpowering liquid mass, there are still,
below the Missouri, rocky banks, and occasionally isolated cliffs,
to stand up and resist its sweep; but its alluvions become wider
and deeper opposite to these rocky barriers. Its bends stretch
over greater distances, and its channel grows deeper at every accession
of a tributary. The chief of these, after passing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Missouri, are from the Rocky Mountains and Ozark slopes, the
St. Francis, White, Arkansas, and Red Rivers; and from the other
bank the Kaskaskia, the Ohio, Wolf, and Yazoo. It is estimated
to flow twelve hundred miles below the Missouri. Its width is
about one mile opposite St. Louis. It is narrower but more than
twice the depth at New Orleans, and yet narrower, because more
divided, at its embouchure at the Balize, where a bar prevents
ships drawing over eighteen feet of water from entering.</p>

<p>No attempt has heretofore been made to determine the elevation
of that part of the American continent which gives rise to
the Mississippi River. From the observations made on the expedition,
the elevation is confessedly less than would _à priori_
be supposed. If it is not, like the Nile, cradled among mountains,
whose very altitude and position are unknown, there is
enough of the unknown about its origin to wish for more information.
Originating on a vast continental plateau, or watershed,
the superabundance of its waters are drained off by the three
greatest rivers of North America, namely, the St. Lawrence, the
Nelson's rivers of Hudson's Bay, and the Mississippi. Yet the
apex of this height of land is moderate, although its distance
from the sea at either point is immense. From the best data at
command, I have endeavored to come at the probable altitude of
this plateau, availing myself at the same time of the judgment of
the several members of the expedition. Taking the elevation of
Lake Erie above tide-water, as instrumentally determined, in the
New York surveys, as a basis, we find Lake Superior lying at
an altitude of six hundred and forty-one feet above the Atlantic.
From thence, through the valley of the St. Louis, and across the
Savanna summit, to the Mississippi, at the confluence of the Sandy
Lake River, estimates noted on the route, indicate an aggregate
rise of four hundred and ninety feet. The ascent of the river,
from this point to Cass Lake, is estimated to be one hundred and
sixty-two feet; giving this lake an aggregate elevation of thirteen
hundred and ninety-three feet above the Atlantic. Barometrical
admeasurements made in 1836, by Mr. Nicollet, in the service of
the United States Topographical Bureau, place the elevation of
this lake at fourteen hundred and two feet above the Gulf of
Mexico,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[79]</a> being just twelve feet above these early estimates. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>same authority estimates its length from the Balize, at twenty-seven
hundred and fifty miles. Its velocity below Cass Lake may
be estimated to result from a mean descent of a fraction over five
inches per mile.</p>

<p>The name of the Mississippi River is derived from the Algonquin
language, through the medium of the French. The term
appears first in the early missionary letters from the west end of
Lake Superior about 1660. Sippi, agreeably to the early French
annotation of the word, signifies a river. The prefixed word
Missi is an adjective denoting all, and, when applied to various
waters, means the collected or assembled mass of them. The
compound term is then, properly speaking, an adverb. Thus,
Missi-gago, means all things; Missi-gago-gidjetod, He who has
made all things&mdash;the Creator. It is a superlative expression, of
which great river simply would be a most lean, impracticable,
and inadequate expression. It is only symbolically that it can be
called the father of American rivers, unless such sense occurs in
the other Indian tongues.</p>

<p>Finding it impracticable to proceed higher in the search of the
remote sources of the river at this time, a return from this point
was determined on. The vicinity had been carefully scanned for
its drift specimens, and fresh-water conchology. Wishing to
carry along some further memorial of the visit, members of the
party cut walking-canes in the adjoining thickets, and tied them
carefully together; and at five o'clock in the afternoon (21st July)
we embarked on our descent. An hour's voyage over the surface
of this wide lake, with its refreshing views of northern scenery,
brought us to the point where the Mississippi issues from it.
Never did men ply their paddles with greater animation; and
having the descent now in their favor, they proceeded eighteen
miles before they sought for a spot to encamp. Twilight still
served, with almost the clearness of daylight, while we spread
our tents on a handsome eminence on the right-hand shore. Daylight
had not yet dawned the next morning, when we resumed
the descent. It was eight o'clock A. M. when we reached the
border of Lake Winnipek. This name, by the way, is derived
from a term heretofore given, which, having the Chippewa
inflection of nouns in <i>ish</i>, graphically describes that peculiarity
of its waters created by the disturbance of a clay bottom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
The winds were high and adverse, which caused the canoemen
to toil two hours in crossing. After reaching the river again,
we passed its sedgy borders, to, and through Rush Lake, or the
Little Winnipek; then by the inlet of Leech Lake River, and
through the contortions of its channel, to within a few miles of
the spot of our encampment at Deer River, on the 20th.</p>

<p>The great savannas, through which the Mississippi winds itself
above the Pakagama, are called collectively, the Gatchi Betobeeg,
Great Morasses, or bog meadows.</p>

<p>While descending the river, we encountered nine canoes filled
with Chippewa Indians and their families. They were freighted
with heavy rolls of birch-bark, such as their canoes are made
from; together with bundles of rushes designed for mats. The
annoyance suffered from mosquitos on this great plateau, was
almost past endurance. We embarked again at a quarter past
four, and reached the Falls of Pakagama at five o'clock. Just
forty minutes were spent in making the portage. The rock at
this spot is quartzite. The day was cloudy, with some rain.
As night approached an animal, judged to be the wolverine, was
seen swimming across the stream. The efforts of the men to overtake
it were unavailing; it nimbly eluded pursuit, and dashed
away into the thickets. In some queries sent to me by the
New York Lyceum, this animal is alluded to as a species of the
glutton. The Indians said there was no animal in their country
deserving this name; the only animal they knew deserving
of it, was the horse; which was eating all the time. We encamped
on an abrupt sandy bank, where, however, sleep was
impossible. Between the humidity of the atmosphere and the
denseness of the foliage around us, the insect world seemed
to have been wakened into unusual activity. Besides, we encamped
so late, and were so jaded by a long day's travel, that
the mosquito-nets were neglected. To get up and stand before
a camp-fire at midnight and switch off the mosquitos, requires
as much philosophy as to write a book; and at any rate,
ours completely failed. We were again in our canoes (24th),
at an early hour. Daylight apprised us of the clearing up of the
atmosphere, and brought us one of the most delightful days.
Animated by these circumstances, we descended the stream
with rapidity. Soon after midday, we entered and ascended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
short channel of the Sandy Lake River, and, by two o'clock in
the afternoon, we rejoined our camp at the Fur Company's Fort,
having been three days in descending a distance which had consumed
four and a half in the ascent.</p>

<p>We were received with joy and acclamation by the Sandy
Lake party, and felicitated ourselves on the accomplishment of
what had all along appeared as the most arduous part of our
route. Nor had we indeed, overrated its difficulties; the incessant
motion of travelling depriving us of mature opportunities of
observation, and also rest at night, the stings of the mosquitos
whenever we attempted to land, and the cravings of an often unsatisfied
appetite, had made this visit one of peculiar privation
and fatigue. Without such an effort, however, it is doubtful
whether the principal objects of the expedition could have been
accomplished. Nothing untoward had happened at the camp,
no difficulty had occurred with the Indians, and all the party
were in good health. Having left my thermometer with Mr.
Doty, during my absence, the observations made by him are
denoted in the appendix.</p>

<p>The following day was fixed on for our departure for the Falls
of St. Anthony. The distance to these falls is generally put by
the traders at from five to six hundred miles. These estimates
denote, however, rather the difficulties and time employed by days'
journeys in the trade than any other measurements.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[80]</a> Pike states
the latitude some thirteen minutes too far north. It is found to
be 46° 47´ 10´´. It appears from Lieut. Pike (<i>Expt.</i> p. 60), that
the stockade at this place was erected in 1794. Its elevation
above the Gulf of Mexico is 1,253 feet. The soil of the environs
yields excellent potatoes, and such culinary vegetables as have
been tried. The mean temperature of July is denoted to be 73°.
The post is one of importance in the fur trade. It yields the
deer, moose, bear, beaver, otter, martin, muskrat, and some other
species, whose skins or pelts are valuable.</p>

<p>It was twelve o'clock on the morning of the 25th, before we
were ready to embark. Our flotilla now consisted of three canoes,
of the kind called <i>Canoe-allege</i> in the trade, and a barge occupied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>by the military. To this array, the chief Babesakundiba, or the
Curly Head, added a canoe filled with Chippewa delegates, who
accompanied him on a mission of peace to the Sioux. This chief
is the same individual who met Lieut. Pike in this quarter, in
1806, and he appears to be a man of much energy and decision
of character. His reputation also gives him the character of
great skill, policy, and bravery in conducting the war against the
Sioux. Indian wars are not conducted as with us, by opposing
armies. It is altogether a guerilla affair. War parties are raised,
marched, fight, and disperse in a few days. The war is carried
on altogether by stealth and stratagem. Each one furnishes himself
with food and weapons. In such a warfare, there is great
scope for individual exploits and daring. In these wars the
Curly Head had greatly distinguished himself, and he was, therefore,
an ambassador of no mean power. In every view, the mission
assumed an interesting character; and we kept an eye on the
chief's movements, on our journey down the river, chiefly that we
might notice the caution which is observed by the Indians in
entering an enemy's country.</p>

<p>After entering the Mississippi, below Sandy Lake, the stream
presents very much the character it has above. It was below
this point that we first observed the juglans nigra in the forest.
Its banks are diluvial or alluvial formations, elevated from six to
ten feet. The elm, maple, and pine are common. There are some
small grassy islands, with tufts of willows, and driftwood lodged.
No rock strata appear. The river winds its way through vast diluvial
beds, exhibiting at its rapids granitical, quartz, and trappose
boulders. It appears to glide wholly over the primitive or crystalline
rocks, which rise in some places through the soil, or show
themselves at rapids. The expedition descended the stream
twenty-eight miles, and encamped on a sandy elevation on the
west shore, near Alder River, which seemed to promise an exemption
from the annoyance of insects; but in this we were mistaken.
In the hurry of a late encampment, it had been omitted
to pitch the tents. The first ill effect of this was felt on being
awakened at night by rain. A humid atmosphere is ever the
signal for awakening hordes of insects, and the mosquitos became
so troublesome that it was impossible to sleep at all after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the shower. We got up and whiled away the time as best we
could around the camp-fire.</p>

<p>We embarked a few minutes before 5 A. M., the morning being
lowering and overcast, which eventuated in rain within an hour.
The atmosphere resumed its serenity, and the sun shone out at
noon. The river, as on the preceding day, has its course between
alluvial and diluvial banks, sweeping its way over the smooth
orbicular beds of the granitical age. The influx of rivers, the
occurrence of islands, which bear witness of their entire submersion
during the freshets, and the succession of bends, points, and
rapids&mdash;these changes, with notices of the wild fowl, forest birds,
and sometimes a quadruped, or a mass of boulders, absorbed my
notices, which it seems unimportant, at this time, to refer to. No
fixed stratification of rocks was encountered this day.</p>

<p>We encamped at about eight o'clock, on the east bank, on an
open eminence, just below the rapids which mark the confluence
of Pine River, having been in our canoes, with very brief and
infrequent landings, fifteen hours. At the points of landing, I observed
the rosa parviflora, and ipomea nil. As night approached,
we heard the monotonous notes of the caprimulgus virginianus.
We had also observed during the day, the bald eagle, king-fisher,
turdus polyglottis, teal, plover, robin, and pigeon. The nimble
sciuris vulgaris was also observed on shore. Boulders of sienite,
hornblende rock, silicious slate, sandstone, and quartz, served as
so many monuments to testify that heavy oceanic currents had
heretofore disrupted the northern stratification, and poured down
over these long and gradual geological slopes.</p>

<p>High and open as our position was on this eminence, our old
friends the mosquitos did not forget us. Even the Indians could
not endure their continued attacks. A fine fellow of our original
auxiliaries, called Iaba Waddik, or the Buck, took this occasion to
give us a specimen of his English, exclaiming, as he came to the
camp-fire, "Tia!<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[81]</a> no sneep!" putting the usual interchangeable
<i>n</i> of the tribe for the <i>l</i> in the noun.</p>

<p>The night dew was heavy on this elevation, and a dense fog
prevailed at the hour of our embarkation (5 o'clock A. M., on
the 27th). The pine lands come in with the valley of Pine River,
a large and important stream tributary from the west, which has a
connection with Leech Lake. These lands characterize both banks
of the Mississippi to the entrance of the River De Corbeau. We
were seven hours, with a strong current, in passing through this
tract. It is to be observed that ancient fires have been permitted
to run through these forests, destroying immense quantities of
the timber. It was twelve o'clock, A. M., when we came opposite
to the entrance of the great Crow-wing River.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[82]</a> This stream,
which has a large island in its mouth, is a prime tributary with a
large, full-flowing current, and must bring in one-third of the entire
volume of water to this point.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[83]</a> Such is the effect of this
current on the opposite shore, that, at the distance of a couple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>of leagues below, at a spot called <i>Prairie Perciê</i> by the French, it
appears to have forced its way headlong, till, meeting obstructions
from the primary rocks, it was again deflected south. At this
point, the whole face of the country has an exceedingly sylvan
aspect. It is made up of far-stretching plains, covered with grass
and wild flowers, interspersed with groves of oak, maple, and
other species. The elevation of these beautiful plains, above the
river, is not less than twenty to thirty feet, placing them above
the reach of high waters. We were now passing below the latitude
of 46°. Everything indicated a climate favorable to the
vegetable kingdom. While passing in the valley, through the
fine bends which the river makes, through these plains, we came
to a hunting-camp of probably one hundred and fifty Indians.
They were Chippewas, who, on landing at their camp, saluted us
in the Indian fashion, and were happy to exchange some dried
buffalo meat and pemmican, for corn and flour. Some miles
below we observed several buffalo, on the eastern shore, on the
sub-plains below the open bluffs. Alarmed by our approach,
these animals set out, with a clumsy, shambling trot, for the upper
plains. Clumsy as their gait seemed, they got over the ground
with speed. Our whole force was immediately landed, a little
below, and we eagerly climbed the banks, to engage in the sport
of hunting them. Quite a large drove of this animal was seen
on the prairie. Our best marksmen, and the Indians, immediately
divided themselves, to approach on different sides the herd. Cautiously
approaching, they fired; the effect was to alarm and divide
them. Most of the herd pushed directly to the spot on the banks
of the river, where the non-combatants of the party stood; and
there arose a general firing, and <i>mêlée</i> of men and buffaloes, which
made it quite doubtful, for awhile, who stood in greatest danger
of being hit by the bullets, the men or animals. I am certain the
bullets whizzed about the position I occupied on the top of the
alluvial cliffs. None of the herd were, however, slain at that
time; but at our encampment, a short distance below, the flesh of
both the buffalo and elk was profusely brought in by the Indians.
It is stated that this animal lifts both the feet on one side, at the
same time; but this remark, I presume, arises from a mode of
throwing its feet forward, which is decidedly different from other
quadrupeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
On descending the river two miles, the next morning, we found
ourselves opposite the mouth of Elk River, a stream coming in
from the west. This point has been determined to be but four
minutes north of latitude 46° [<i>Sen. Doc.</i> 237]. A short distance
below the river, we passed, on the west shore, the Painted Rock,
an isolated or boulder mass, having Indian devices, which we had
no opportunity of examining. We were now passing down a
channel of manifestly increased velocity, and at the distance of a
couple of miles more, found ourselves hurried through the west
channel of the Little Falls. At this point the primitive or basis
stratification over which we had been so long gliding, crosses the
river, rising up and dividing it, by an abrupt rocky island, into
two channels. The breadth of the stream is much compressed,
and the velocity of its current increased. By what propriety of
language it is called "falls" did not, however, appear; perhaps
there are seasons when the descent assumes a greater degree of
disturbance and velocity. To us, it appeared to be about ten feet
in a hundred and fifty yards. Here, then, in N. lat. 46°, the Mississippi
is first visibly crossed by the primary series of rocks.</p>

<p>Being now in the region of buffalo, it was decided to land in
the course of the day, for the purpose of entering into the chase.
An occasion for this was presented soon after passing the Little
Falls, by observing one of these animals on shore. On landing,
and reaching the elevation of the prairies, two herds of them were
discovered at a distance. An attack on them was immediately
planned, for which the tall grass and gentle inequalities of surface,
appeared favorable. The fire proved unsuccessful, but served
to distract the herds, giving scope for individual marksmanship
and hunter activity, during which, innumerable shots were fired,
and three animals killed. While this scene was passing, I had a
good stand for witnessing the sport, some of the herd passing by
very near, as with the blindness of fury. The bison is certainly
an animal as clumsy as the ox, or domestic cow; but, unlike these,
it is of a uniform dun color, and ever without being spotted, or
mottled. Its horns are nearly straight, short, very black, and set
wide apart. The male is formidable in look, and ferocious when
wounded. Its ordinary weight is eight hundred to a thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>It may be said, in reference to this animal being found in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
region, that it is a kind of neutral ground, between the Chippewas
and Sioux, neither of which tribes permanently occupy the country
between the mouth of the Raven's-wing and Rum Rivers.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[84]</a></p>

<p>Having spent several hours in the chase, we again embarked,
and proceeded down the river until three o'clock in the afternoon.
On the left bank of the river two prominent elevations of
the granitical series, rising through the prairie soil, attracted my
attention. Immediately below this locality, a high and level prairie
stretches on the west shore, which had a striking appearance from
its being crowned with the poles and fixtures of a large, recently
abandoned Sioux encampment. At this spot the expedition
landed and encamped. The quick glances of Babasikundiba and
his party of delegates immediately discovered a pole, at the site of
the chief's lodge, bearing a birch bark scroll, or letter, inscribed
with Indian hieroglyphics, or devices. It turned out that this
spot was the northern terminus of a Sioux peace embassage, dispatched
from St. Peter's shortly previous, under the direction of
Col. H. Leavenworth, U. S. A., the newly-arrived commanding
officer at that post. The message was eagerly received and read
by the Chippewa delegates. By it they were informed that the
Sioux also desired a termination of hostilities. The scroll was
executed by tracing lines, with the point of a knife, or some sharp
instrument. The pictographic devices thus drawn denoted the
exact number of the party, their chiefs, and the authority under
which these crude negotiations were commenced.</p>

<p>Of this mode of communicating ideas among the Algonquin
tribes, we have before given details in crossing the boggy plateau
of Akik Sepi, between the St. Louis River and Sandy Lake.
The present instance of it is commented on in an interesting communication
of the era, in the appendix, from the pen of Gov. Cass.
It was now no longer doubtful that the Chippewa mission would
be successful, and the satisfaction it produced was evident in
the countenances and expressions of Babasikundiba and his colleagues.</p>

<p>I took a canoe and crossed the Mississippi, to inspect the geology
of the opposite shore. On reaching the summit of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>rock formations rising through the prairies, which had attracted
my notice from the river, I found them to consist of sienite,
which was almost exclusively made up of a trinary compound
of white quartz, hornblende, and feldspar&mdash;the two former
species predominating. The feldspar exhibited its splendent black
crystals in fine relief in the massy quartz. This formation extended
a mile or more. What excited marked attention, in surveying
these rocks, was their smoothly rubbed surfaces, which
seemed as if they must have been produced by equally hard and
heavy masses of rock, driven over them from the north. I registered
this locality, in my Geological Journal, as the Peace Rock,
in allusion to the purport of the Indian mission, evidences of
which were found at the opposite encampment.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[85]</a></p>

<p>During our night's encampment at this spot we heard the howling
of a pack of wolves, on the opposite bank&mdash;a sure indication,
hunters say, that there are deer, or objects of prey in the vicinity.
There are two species of wolves on the plains of the Mississippi&mdash;the
canis lupus, and the animal called coyote by the Spanish.
The latter is smaller, of a dingy yellow color, and bears the
generic name of prairie wolf. I have also seen a black wolf on
the prairies of Missouri and Arkansas, three feet nine inches long,
with coarse, bristly, bear-like hair. As daylight approached, our
ears were saluted with the hollow cry of the strix nictea, a species
which is asserted to be found, sometimes, as far south as the Falls
of St. Anthony.</p>

<p>On embarking, at an early hour, we found the humidity of the
night atmosphere to be such, that articles left exposed to it were
completely saturated. Yet, the temperature stood at 50° at half-past
four o'clock, the moment of our embarkation. On descending
six miles we passed the mouth of the Osakis, or Sac River, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>considerable tributary from the west, which opens a line of communication
with the Red River valley.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock we encountered a series of rapids extending
some eight hundred or a thousand yards, in the course of which
the river has a probable aggregate fall of sixteen feet. These
rapids bear the malappropriate title of the Big Falls. Following
these, were a series called Prairie Rapids. At half-past four we
passed the entrance of the River St. Francis, a considerable stream
on the left bank. At this spot, Hennepin terminated his voyage
in 1681, and Carver in 1766. There is an island at the point of
confluence. At six o'clock we passed the entrance on the west
shore of the stream called <i>Corneille</i>, by the French, which is the
true interpretation of the Sioux name <i>Karishon</i>, and the Chippewa
term <i>Andaig</i>, which mean the crow, and not the raven. We
encamped five miles below, on the east bank, having been thirteen
hours in our canoes, with a generally strong current. My
mineralogical gleanings, during the day, had given some specimens
of the interesting varieties of the quartz family, for which
the geological drift is noted, and a single piece of agatized wood.
The geological floor on which the river runs, has been indicated.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the following morning (30th) we resumed the
descent, and at the distance of two leagues reached the entrance
of the Missisagiegon, or Rum River. It is Carver, I believe, who
first gives us this name, for a stream which the Indians describe
as a river flowing from a lake of lakes&mdash;a term, by the way, which
the French, with their usual adherence to Indian etymology, have
called <i>Mille Lacs</i>. The term <i>missi</i>, in this word, does not signify
great, but a collected mass, or all kinds, and sometimes everywhere&mdash;the
allusion being to water. <i>Sa-gi-e-gon</i> is a lake, and
when the prefixed term <i>missi</i>, is put to it, nothing could more
graphically describe the large body of water, interspersed with
islands, which give a confused aspect, from which the river issues.
The Dacotas call this lake <i>Mini Wakan</i>, meaning Spirit-water,
which is probably the origin of the name of Rum River.</p>

<p>About thirteen miles below Rum River, and when within half
a mile of the Falls,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[86]</a> I observed calcareous rocks in horizontal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>beds, on the left bank of the river. It was now evident we had
passed out of the primitive range of deposits, and had entered
that of the great sedimentary horizontal and semi-crystalline or
silurian system of the Mississippi Valley; and descending with a
strong current, we came, rather suddenly, it appeared, to the Falls
of St. Anthony, where the river drops, by a cascade, into a rock-bordered
valley. Surprise and admiration were the first emotions
on getting out of our canoes and gazing on this superlative
scene; and we were not a little struck with the idea that the Sioux
had named the Falls from manifestly similar impressions, calling
it Rara, from the Dacota verb <i>irara</i>, to laugh. By another authority,
the word is written <i>Ha Ha</i>, or <i>Dhaha</i>, the letters <i>h</i> in the
word representing a strong guttural sound resembling the old
Arabic r.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[87]</a> (S. R. Riggs's <i>Dakota Dict. and Gram.</i>) Nothing can
exceed the sylvan beauty of the country which is here thrown
before the eye; and we should not feel surprised that the Aboriginal
mind has fallen on very nearly identical sounds with the
English, to express its impressions. A not very dissimilar principle
has been observed by the Chippewas, who have a uniform
termination of their names in <i>ish</i>, which signifies the very same
quality which we express by ish in whitish, blackish, saltish&mdash;meaning
a lesser, or defective quality of the noun.</p>

<p>The popular name of these Falls, it is known, is due to Father
Louis Hennepin, a missionary who accompanied La Salle to the
Illinois, in 1679, and was carried captive into the country of the
Issati, a Dacota tribe, in 1680. Lt. Pike states the portage to be
two hundred and sixty poles. By the time we had taken a good
view of the position, and made a few sketches, the men had completed
carrying over our baggage and canoes. It was now one
o'clock, when we embarked to proceed to the newly-established
military encampment, a few miles below. It was a noticeable
feature, in our descent of the river above the Falls, that Babasikundiba
had always kept behind the flotilla of canoes; but the
moment we advanced below the Falls, he shot ahead with his
delegates, each one being dressed out in his best manner. His
canoe had its little flag displayed&mdash;the Indian drum was soon
heard sending its measured thumps and murmurs of vocal accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>paniment
over the water, and ever and anon guns were fired.
All this was done that the enemy might be apprised of the approach
of the delegation in the boldest and most open manner.
It was eight or nine miles to the post, near the influx of the St.
Peter's, and long before we reached Col. Leavenworth's camp, which
occupied a high bluff, the attention of the Sioux was arrested by
their advance, and it was inferable from the friendly answering
shouts which they gave, that the mission was received with joy.
Although we had known nothing of the movement which produced
the pictographic letter found on a pole at the Petite Roche,
above Sac River, it was, in fact, regarded by the Dacotas as an
answer to that letter. And the Chippewa chief, and his followers,
were received with a salute by the Sioux, by whom they were
taken by the hand, individually, as they landed.</p>

<p>Col. Leavenworth, the commanding officer, received the expedition
in the most cordial manner, and assigned quarters for
the members. Gov. Cass was received with a salute due to his
rank. We learn that the post was established last fall. Orders
for this purpose were issued, as will be seen by reference to the
<i>Preliminary Documents</i>, p. 35, early in the spring. The troops
destined for this purpose, were placed under the orders of Col.
Leavenworth, who had distinguished himself as the commander
of the ninth and twenty-second regiments, in the war of 1812.
They left Detroit in the spring (1819), and proceeding by the way
of Green Bay and Prairie du Chien, where garrisons were left,
they ascended to the mouth of the St. Peter's, in season to erect
cantonments before winter. The site chosen, being on the alluvial
grounds, proved unhealthy, in consequence of which the cantonment
was removed, in the spring of 1820, to an eminence and
spring on the west bank of the Mississippi, about a mile from
the former position.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Position of the military post established at the mouth of the St. Peter's&mdash;Beauty,
salubrity, and fertility of the country&mdash;Pictographic letter&mdash;Indian treaty&mdash;The
appearance of the offer of frankincense in the burning of tobacco&mdash;Opwagonite&mdash;native

of green corn.</p>

<p>In favor of the soil and climate, and of the salubrity of the
position, the officers speak in terms of the highest admiration.
The garrison has directed its attention to both horticulture and
agriculture. About ninety acres of the choicest bottom land
along the St. Peter's Valley, and the adjacent prairies, have been
planted with Indian corn and potatoes, cereal grains, and esculents,
inclusive of a hospital, a regimental, and private gardens.
At the mess-table of Col. Leavenworth, and in our camp, we were
presented with green corn in the ear, peas, beans, cucumbers,
beets, radishes, and lettuce. The earliest garden peas were eaten
here on the 15th of June, and the first green corn on the 20th
July. Much of the corn is already too hard for the table, and
some of the ears can be selected which are ripe enough for
seed corn. Wheat, on the prairie lands, is found to be entirely
ripe, and melons in the military gardens nearly so. These are
the best practical commentaries on the soil and climate.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[88]</a></p>

<p>The distance of the St. Peter's from the Gulf of Mexico is estimated
to be about two thousand two hundred miles. Its position
above St. Louis is estimated at nine hundred miles. Its elevation
above the Gulf is but 744 feet. The precise latitude of this point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>is 44° 52´ 46´´.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[89]</a> The atmosphere is represented as serene and
transparent during the summer and spring seasons, and free from
the humidity which is so objectionable a trait of our eastern latitudes.
The mean temperature is 45°.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[90]</a> Its geology and mineralogy
will be noticed in my official reports. It will be sufficient
here to say that the stratification, at and below St. Anthony's
Falls, consists wholly of formations of sandstones and limestones,
horizontally deposited, whose relative positions and ages are
chiefly inferable from the evidences of organic life, in the shape
of petrifactions, which they embrace. The lowest of this series
of rocks is a white sandstone, consisting of transparent, loosely
cohering grains, special allusion to which is made by Carver, in
his travels in 1766, and which may be received as testimony, were
there no other, that this too much discredited author had actually
visited this region.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the interest excited by our Chippewas finding
the bark letter, or pictographic memorial at the deserted
Sioux encampment above Sac River. It turned out, as we were
informed, that this Aboriginal missive was a reply to a similar
proposition transmitted from Sandy Lake, by the Chippewas.
The very person, indeed, who inscribed the Chippewa bark message,
was one of the ten persons who had accompanied us from
that lake. Gov. Cass, on learning this fact, requested him to draw
a duplicate of it on a roll of bark. He executed this task immediately.
We thus had before us the proposition in this symbolic
character, which is called <i>ke ke win</i> by the Chippewas, and
its answer. By this mode of communication two nations of the
most diverse language found no difficulty in understanding each
other.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[91]</a></p>

<p>On the second day after our arrival, the Indians consummated
their intentions, as signified by the bark letter, and the Sandy-Lake
delegation assembled with the Sioux at the old quarters of
the military, now occupied as an Indian agency, and smoked the
pipe of peace. There were present at this pacification, besides
the chiefs Shacopee and Babasikundiba, and minor chieftains,
His Excellency Gov. Cass, Col. Leavenworth, and sundry officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>of the garrison and the expedition. The ceremonies were conducted
under the auspices of the U. S. Indian Agent, Mr. Taliaferro.
Every attention was given to make these ceremonies
impressive, by a compliance with the Aboriginal customs on these
occasions, and it is hoped not without leaving permanent effects
on their minds.</p>

<p>The pipe employed by the native diplomatists, in these negotiations,
is invested with a symbolic and sacred character, as if the
fumes of the weed were offered, in the nature of frankincense, to
the Deity. The genuflections with which it is presented, more
than the words expressed, countenance this idea. The bowl of
the pipe used on this occasion consisted of the well-known red
pipe-stone, called opwagonite,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[92]</a> so long known in Indian history as
being brought from the <i>Coteau des Prairies</i>. It is furnished with
a wooden stem two or three feet long, and two and a half inches
broad, shaved down thin so as to resemble a spatula. It is then
painted with certain blue or green clays, and ornamented with
braids of richly dyed porcupine quills, or the holcus fragrans, and
the tuft feathers of the male duck or red-headed woodpecker.
These state pipes are usually presented by the speakers as memorials
of the speeches, and laid aside by the officials having
charge of Indian affairs. Col. Leavenworth presented us with
some of these carefully ornamented diplomatic testimonials.</p>

<p>I obtained from the Sioux some very carefully moulded pyramidal-shaped
pieces of the blue and green clays from the valley
of the St. Peter's, which they employ in painting their pipe-stems
and persons. The coloring matter of these appears to be carbonate
of copper. It is brought from the Blue Earth River. I also
obtained from the Indians very small and carefully tied leathern
bags of the red oxide of iron, which they obtain in the state of a
dry, powdery mass, on the prairies near the Big Stone. The
Indians brought me, from the same region, crystals of salt, scraped
up from the margin of certain waters on the prairies, of a dark
cast, mixed with impurities. The tendency of these crystals to
assume a cubic form was quite distinct. The most interesting
development, in the mineralogical way, consisted of small lumps
of native copper, which I obtained on an eminence on the banks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>of the Mississippi, directly opposite the influx of the St. Peter's.
They occupy, geologically, a diluvial position, being at the bottom
of the prairie-drift stratum, and immediately above the superior
limestone.</p>

<p>In the luxurious kitchen gardens of Camp Leavenworth, great
depredations have been made by a small quadruped of a burrowing
character, called gopher. By patient watching, gun in hand,
one of these was killed, and its skin preserved and prepared.
The animal is ten inches long to the termination of the tail, with
a body very much the size and color of a large wharf-rat. It has
five prominent claws, and two broad cutting teeth, but its most
striking peculiarity is a duplicature of the cheek, which permits
it to carry earth to the mouth of its burrow. It has been called
the pouched rat. Sir Francis Drake found a similar animal in
his visit to the Gulf of California, in 1587. The distribution of
this species, of which this seems to be the northern limit, is very
wide through Atlantic America, and it is known to be destructive
to vegetation throughout Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas. I
had, two years ago, been led to notice its ravages in Missouri
and Arkansas. But the animal called gopher, in the southern
country, is a burrowing tortoise, and the name is improperly applied
to this species, which is the <i>Pseudostoma pinetorum</i>.</p>

<p>A peculiar species of squirrel was observed in this vicinity,
which is also found to be a destructive visitor to the military
gardens. In appearance, this species resembles the common
striped squirrel, but it has a more elongated body, and shorter
legs. The body has six black stripes, with the same number of
intervening lines of spots, on a reddish-brown skin. This Minnesota
squirrel has, since the return of the Expedition, been named,
by the late Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell, <i>sciurus tredeceum</i>.</p>

<p>The River St. Peter's is called, by the Dacotas, <i>Watepa Minnesota</i>.
The prefixed term <i>watepa</i>, is their word for river; <i>minni</i>
is the name for water. The term <i>sota</i> has been variously explained.
The Canadian French, who have proved themselves
most apt translators of Indian phrases, render it by the word
<i>brouille</i>, or <i>blear</i>; or, if we regard this as derivative from the verb
<i>brouiller</i>, <i>mixed</i>, or <i>mottled</i>&mdash;a condition of the waters of this river,
whenever the Mississippi is in flood, and consequently at a higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>elevation when it rushes into the mouth of the St. Peter's, producing
that addled aspect of the water, to which the Dacotas, it is
believed, apply the term <i>sota</i>.</p>

<p>The scenery around St. Peter's is of the most sylvan and delightful
character. About six miles west of the cantonment there are
several beautiful lakes, in the prairies. The largest of these is
about four miles in circumference, and is called Calhoun Lake,
in compliment to the Secretary of War. Its waters are stored
with bass and other varieties of fish. There are several pure
springs of sparkling water, issuing from the picturesque cliffs
which face the Mississippi at this place. I visited one about a
mile from the cantonment, which deposits a yellow sulphurous
flocculent mass along its course. On the prairies is found the <i>holcus
fragrans</i>, which is braided by the Indian females, and employed
in some instances to decorate their deer-skin clothing. This aromatic
grass retains its scent in the dried state. Along the waters
of the St. Peter's is found the <i>acer negundo</i>, the inner bark of
which, mixed with the common nettle, is employed by the natives
in the state of a strong decoction, as a cure for the <i>lues venerea</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver having described certain antiquities near the foot of
Lake Pepin, in 1766, inquiries were made after objects of this
kind in the vicinity. I was informed that traces of such remains
existed in the valley of the St. Peter's, but can say nothing concerning
them from actual inspection.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[93]</a></p>

<p>Of the Dacotas, or Sioux, for which St. Peter's forms the central
point, some anecdotes have been related which denote that they
are, on certain occasions, actuated by exalted motives. It is related
that the chief Little Crow, going out to the confines of the
Chippewa Territory, to examine his beaver-traps, discovered an
individual of that tribe in the act of taking a beaver from the trap.
As he was himself unperceived, the tribes being at war, and the
offence an extreme one, a summary punishment would have been
justified by Indian law. But the Sioux chief decided differently:
"Take no alarm," said he, approaching the offender: "I come to
present you the trap, of which I see you stand in need. Take my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>gun, also, as I see you have none of your own, and return to the
land of your countrymen; and linger not here, lest some of my
young men should discover your footsteps."</p>

<p>A still more striking and characteristic incident is related of a
chief called the Red Thunder. Col. Wm. Dixon, a Scotchman of
family, who made his influence felt in the late war of 1812 as a
leader of the Sioux and a merchant among them, married the
sister of this notable chief. So daring were the acts of Red Thunder,
that he had put the Chippewa nation in awe of him. At
length, however, after a long series of the bravest acts, he was
taken prisoner, with a favorite dog, and condemned to expiate his
offences at the stake. It was a time of want by his captors. One
day he said to them: "Why do you not feed my dog?" They
replied, "feed him yourself." " Then," he said, "give me a knife."
This being thrown to him, he cut a piece of flesh from one of his
large and fleshy thighs, and threw it to the dog. Admiration of
this act ran through the Indian camp. They immediately released
him, and bestowed on him the highest attentions and honors.</p>

<p>The Dacota or Sioux nation constitute one of the families of
America who speak a peculiar language. Lieut. Pike, who visited
them in 1806, estimated their numerical strength at twenty-one
thousand six hundred and seventy-five; of which number he computed
three thousand eight hundred to be warriors. They consist
of six or seven independent tribes, or sub-tribes, bearing
different names, who occupy most of the country between the
Mississippi and Missouri, between N. latitude 43° and 46°. The
Mendawekantoñs are located on the Mississippi, below the Falls of
St. Anthony and the mouth of the St. Peter's. The Sessitoñs and
Yanktoñs occupy the upper waters of the St. Peter's. The Titoñs
only extend west of the Missouri. The several tribes regard
themselves as a confederacy, which is the signification of the term
Dacota. They do not acknowledge the name of Sioux as an
Indian word. We first hear of them from the early French missionaries,
who visited the head of Lake Superior about the middle
of the 17th century, under the name of <i>Nadowasie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[94]</a> They speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>a language which prevails over an immense area, which is now
occupied by the prairie tribes towards the west and southwest,
from whence, it is inferred, they came. They appear, at a former
time, to have reached and dwelt at the sources of the Mississippi,
and to have approached, if not reached, the west end of Lake Superior;
for it is from these positions that the oldest traditions
represent them to have been driven by the Chippewas. Lieut.
Pike thinks they are, undeniably, descendants of Tartars. If so,
I feel inclined to think that they must have made the circuit of the
Mexican provinces before reaching the Mississippi Valley, for the
track of their migration is traced towards the south certainly as
far as the country of the Kansas and Osages; while they preserve
some striking traits and characteristics which appear to be referable
to those intertropical regions.</p>

<p>Having passed the better part of three days in the vicinity of
St. Peter's, adding to our collections and portfolios, we left it on
the second of August, and proceeded down the river to the village
of La Petite Corbeau, or the Little Raven, situated on the east
bank not far above the mouth of the St. Croix. The river, in this
distance flows between lofty cliffs of the white sandstone and
neutral-colored limestones, which are first conspicuously displayed
at the Falls of St. Anthony. Springs of water, not infrequently,
issue from these cliffs. We landed at one of these,
flowing in through a gorge at the distance of four miles below
St. Peter's, on the east bank, for the purpose of visiting a remarkable
cave, from the mouth of which a small stream issues.
The cave is seated wholly within the beautiful white crumbling
sandstone rock. It is, in fact, the loose character of the rock
which permits the superincumbent waters of the plains above to
permeate through it, that has originated the cave. The stream
consisted of the purest filtrated water, which is daily carrying
away the loosened grains of sand into the Mississippi, and thus
enlarging the boundaries of the cavern.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[95]</a> We had been erroneously
informed that this was Carver's Cave, and looked in vain
for this traveller's name on its walls.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[96]</a> The atmosphere in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>cave was found to be seven degrees higher than the water. We
noticed nothing in the form of bones or antiquities.</p>

<p>The village of Petite Corbeau consists of twelve large lodges,
which are said to give shelter to two hundred souls. They plant
corn, and cultivate vines and pumpkins. They sallied from their
lodges on seeing us approach, and, gathering along the margin of
the river, fired a <i>feu de joie</i> on our landing. The chief was among
the first to greet us. He is a man below the common size, but
brawny and well proportioned, and, although above fifty years of
age, retains the look and vigor of forty. He invited us to his
lodge&mdash;a spacious building about sixty feet by thirty, substantially
constructed of logs and bark. Being seated, he addressed
himself to His Excellency Gov. Cass. He said that he
was glad to see him in his village. That, in his extensive journey,
he must have suffered many hardships. He must also have
noticed much of the Indian mode of life, and of the face of the
country, which would enable him to see things in their proper
light. He was glad that he had not, like others who had lately
visited the country, passed by his village without calling. He referred,
particularly, to the military force sent to establish a garrison
at St. Peter's, the year before, who had passed up on the other
side of the river. He acquiesced in the treaty that had been recently
concluded with the Chippewas. He referred to a recent
attack of a party of Fox Indians on their people, on the head
waters of the St. Peter's. He said it was dastardly, and that, if
that <i>little</i> tribe should continue their attacks, they would at length
drive him into anger, and compel him to do a thing he did not
wish.</p>

<p>While this speech was being interpreted, the Indian women
were employed in bringing basketsful of ears of Indian corn from
the fields, which they emptied in a pile. This pile, when it had
reached a formidable height, was offered as a present to the Expedition.
It was, indeed, the beginning of the season of green
corn, with them, and we were soon apprised, by the sound of
music from another lodge, that the festival of the green-corn
dance was going forward. Being admitted to see the ceremonies,
the first thing which attracted notice was two large iron kettles
suspended over a fire, filled with green-corn cut from the cob.
The Indians, both men and women, were seated in a large circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
around them; they were engaged in singing a measured chant
in the Indian manner, accompanied by the Sioux cancega or drum
and rattles; the utmost solemnity was depicted on every countenance.
When the music paused, there were certain gesticulations
made, as if a mysterious power were invoked. In the course
of these ceremonies, a young man and his sister, joining hands,
came forward to be received into the green corn society, of whom
questions were asked by the presiding official. At the conclusion
of these, the voice of each member was taken as to their admission,
which was unanimous. At the termination of the ceremonies, an
elderly man came forward and ladled out the contents of the
kettles into separate wooden dishes for each head of a family
present. As these dishes were received, the persons retired from
the lodge by a backward movement, still keeping their faces directed
to the kettles, till they had passed out.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Descent of the river from the site of Little Crow's Village to Prairie du Chien&mdash;Incidents
of the voyage, and notices of the scenery and natural history.</p>

<p>The next morning we embarked at 5 o'clock. On descending
the river six miles, we passed the mouth of the St. Croix.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[97]</a> This
stream heads on high lands, which form a rim of hills around the
southern and western shores of Lake Superior, where it is connected
with the River Misacoda, or Broulè of Fond du Lac. The
Namakagon, its southern branch of it, is connected with the
Maskigo,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[98]</a> or Mauvais River of La Pointe, Lake Superior. Immediately
above its point of entrance into the Mississippi the St.
Croix expands into a beautiful lake, which is some twelve miles
long, and about two in width. The borders of the Mississippi
about this point assume an increased height, and more imposing
aspect. In many places, as the voyager descends from this spot
to Lake Pepin, he observes the calcareous cliffs to terminate in
pyramids; the crest of the hills frequently resemble the crumbling
ruins of antique towers. At 12 o'clock we came to the vicinity
of an isolated calcareous cliff, called La Grange, which may be
regarded as one of those monuments resulting from geological
denudation, which constitute a striking feature in the St. Peter's
region. The top of this cliff affords a fine view of the scenery of
the Mississippi for a long distance above and below it. It has
been found to be three hundred and twenty-two feet above the river.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
This spot is noted as being near the site of Tarangamani, or the
Red Wing's Village. This chief is one of the notable men of his
tribe. He has been long celebrated as a man skilled as a native
magician. The village consists of four large, elongated, and of
several small lodges. Tarangamani is now considered the first
chief of his nation. He is noted for his wisdom and sagacity.
He bears the marks of being sixty years of age. His grand-daughter
married Col. Crawford, a man of commercial activity
about Prairie du Chien and Michilimackinac, during the late war
of 1812, who has left descendants in the lake country. We observed,
at this village, several buffalo skins undergoing the Indian
process of dressing. The hair having been removed, they were
stretched on the ground, where they were subjected to a process
analogous to tanning by being covered with a decoction of oak
bark.</p>

<p>In ascending the hill of La Grange, we first encountered the
rattlesnake, two of which we killed. This is the highest northern
point at which we have observed this species on the Mississippi.
I observed on this elevation small detached masses of radiated
quartz, cinnamon-colored and white, together with an ore of iron
crystallized in cubes. Having cursorily examined the environs,
the expedition again embarked. It was 1 o'clock when we entered
Lake Pepin. This admired lake is a mere expansion of the Mississippi,
having a length of twenty-four miles by a varying width
of from two to four miles. During this distance there is not the
least current during calm weather. The prospects, in passing
through this expanse of water, are of the most picturesque kind.
Its immediate shores are circumscribed with a broad beach of
gravel, in which may be found rolled pieces of the chalcedonies,
agates, and other species of the quartz family, which are
characteristic of the drift-stratum of the upper borders of the
Mississippi. On the eastern shore, at a short distance from the
margin, there is a lofty range of limestone cliffs. On the west,
the eye rests on an elevated formation of prairie, nearly destitute
of trees. From this plain several conical hills ascend, which have
the appearance, but only the appearance, of artificial construction.
The lake is quite transparent, and yields several species of fish.
The most remarkable of these is the <i>acipenser spatularia</i>, of which
we obtained a specimen. It is also remarkable for its numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
varieties, and the large size of its fresh-water shells. I procured
several species of <i>unio</i>, which, from their size and character, attracted
my attention, particularly to the subject of this branch of
American conchology. Several of these, from the duplicates of
my cabinet, have attracted the attention of conchologists.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[100]</a> Lake
Pepin receives a river from the west called the Ocano, or more
properly <i>Au Canot</i>; its mouth having been, in former times, a
noted place for concealing canoes during the winter season.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[101]</a> At
a point, on the east shore, about half way down the lake, where a
small stream enters, we were informed there existed the remains
of an old French fort, or factory; but we did not land to examine
them.</p>

<p>In passing through this lake the interpreters pointed to a high
precipice in the cliffs on the east shore, which Indian tradition
assigns as the locality of a tragical love tale, of which a Dacota
girl was the heroine. To avoid the dilemma of being compelled
to accept a husband of repulsive character, and to sacrifice her
affections for another person, she precipitated herself down this
precipice. The tale has been so differently told to travellers visiting
the region, that nothing but the simple tradition appears worth
recording. Olaita and Winona, have been mentioned as the name
of the Dacota Sappho.</p>

<p>At 6 o'clock in the evening we encamped on a gravelly beach
on the east shore of the lake, the weather threatening a storm.
Rain commenced at 8 o'clock, and continued at intervals, with
severe thunder and most vivid flashes of lightning during the
night. At 5 o'clock the next morning (4th), the expedition was
again in motion. The rain had ceased, but the morning remained
cloudy. The scenery on the borders of the lake continued to be
impressive. The precipices on the east shore shot up into spiral
points; yet the orbicular elevations are covered with grass and
shrubbery. These high grass-crowned elevations, without forest,
terminate near the influx of the Chippewa River in a remarkable
isolated elevation, called <i>Mont La Garde</i>, from the fact that it is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and long has been, a noted look-out station for Chippewa war
parties, who descend this stream, against the Sioux. It commands
an extensive view of Lake Pepin. This lake was thought to be
two miles wide opposite our last night's encampment; it narrows
to probably less than half a mile at its mouth. The west shore
along this portion of the lake consists of singularly striking, picturesque,
level, and elevated prairie lands.</p>

<p>Carver, in 1768, places his remains of ancient circumvallations
in this vicinity, but "some miles below Lake Pepin."<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[102]</a> This was
a period when no attention had been directed to the subject of
antiquities in the United States, and his mind appears to have
been impressed strongly by what he saw. As opportunities did
not allow me to land, nor was the precise spot, indeed, known to
any of our guides or men, reference can only be made to the observations
of a man who is known to have been the first American
traveller that has called attention to our western antiquities.
Mr. H. V. Hart, long a resident of this region, verbally assures
me that he has visited these works.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[103]</a></p>

<p>Chippewa River, just referred to, comes into the Mississippi on
its left bank, within half a mile of the foot of Lake Pepin. It is
a tributary of prime volume, draining the Chippewa territories
lying around the south and west shores of Lake Superior. Originating
on the sandy tracts extending over the elevated central
plains of the Wisconsin, it brings a large deposit of sand into the
Mississippi, the navigation of which is visibly more embarrassed
below this point with sand-bars, willow, and cotton-wood islands.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon we reached and landed at
Wabashaw's village. It is eligibly seated on the west shore,
and consists of four of the large elongated Sioux lodges before
mentioned, containing a population of about sixty souls. The
usual intercourse and speeches of congratulation by the Indians,
and acknowledgment of the American authorities were made, and
we again embarked, after a detention of forty minutes. A few
miles below Wabashaw's village, we came to a high rocky or
mountain island, called <i>La montaigne qui trompe dans l'eau</i>, a term
which is shortened by western phraseology into <span class="smcap">Trompledo</span> mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>ain.
This is a very remarkable feature in the geography of the
Upper Mississippi. The rock is calcareous; it is, in fact, the only
fast or rocky island we have encountered below the little islet at
the head of the Packagama Falls. It is not only striking from its
lofty elevation, but is several miles in circumference; standing in
the bed of the river and parting its channel into two, it appears
to be the first bold geological monument which has effectually
resisted its course.</p>

<p>We had passed this island but a short distance, and the approaches
of evening began to be manifest, when a large gray wolf
sprang into the river to cross it. The greatest animation at once
arose in our flotilla; the canoemen bending themselves to their
paddles, the auxiliary Indians of our party shouting, and the
whole party assuming an unwonted excitement. A shot was soon
fired from one of our rifles, but either the distance was too great,
or the aim incorrect. The wolf was fully apprised of his peril,
put forth all his strength, outstripped his pursuers, reached the
shore, and nimbly leaped into the woods.</p>

<p>We encamped on the west shore, a few miles below the island
at seven o'clock, having been twelve hours in our canoes. The
confinement of the position nobody can appreciate who has not
tried it, and I hastened to stretch my legs, by ascending the river
cliffs in our rear, to have a glimpse of its geology and scenery.
The view westwardly was one of groves and prairies of most
inviting agricultural promise. In front, the island mountain rises
to an elevation which appears to have been the original geological
level of the stratification before the Mississippi cut its way
through it.</p>

<p>At the rapids of Black River, which enters opposite our encampment,
a saw-mill, we were informed, had been erected by an
inhabitant of Prairie du Chien. Thus the empire of the arts
has begun to make its way into these regions, and proclaims the
advance of a heavy civilization into a valley which has heretofore
only resounded to the savage war-whoop. Or, if a higher grade
of society and arts has ever before existed in it, as some of our
tumuli and antiquities would lead us to infer, the light of history
has failed to reach us on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[104]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>At the spot of our encampment, as soon as the shades of night
closed in, we were visited by hordes of ephemera. The candles
lighted in our tents became the points of attraction for these
evanescent creations. They soon, however, began to feel the influence
of the sinking of the thermometer, and the air was imperceptibly
cleared of them in an hour or two. By the hour of
three o'clock the next morning (5th) the expedition was again in
motion descending the river. It halted for breakfast at Painted
Rock, on the west shore. While this matter was being accomplished,
I found an abundant locality of unios in a curve of
the shore which produced an eddy. Fine specimens of U. purpureus,
elongatus, and orbiculatus were obtained. With the
increased spirit and animation which the whole party felt on the
prospect of our arrival at Prairie du Chien, we proceeded unremittingly
on our descent, and reached that place at six o'clock in
the evening.</p>

<p>Prairie du Chien does not derive its name from the dog, but
from a noted family of Fox Indians bearing this name, who anciently
dwelt here. The old town is said to have been about a
mile below the present settlement, which was commenced by Mr.
Dubuque and his associates, in 1783. The prairie is most eligibly
situated along the margin of the stream, above whose floods it is
elevated. It consists of a heavy stratum of diluvial pebbles and
boulders, which is picturesquely bounded by lofty cliffs of the
silurian<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[105]</a> limestones, and their accompanying column of stratification.
The village has the old and shabby look of all the antique
French towns on the Mississippi, and in the great lake basins; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>dwellings being constructed of logs and barks, and the courtyards
picketed in, as if they were intended for defence. It is
called Kipisagee by the Chippewas and Algonquin tribes generally,
meaning the place of the jet or outflow of the (Wisconsin)
River. It is, in popular parlance, estimated to be 300 miles below
St. Peter's, and 600 above St. Louis.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[106]</a> Its latitude is 43° 3´ 6´´.
It is the seat of justice for Crawford County, having been so named
in, honor of W. H. Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury of the
U. S. It is, together with all the region west of Lake Michigan,
attached to the territory of Michigan. There is a large and fertile
island in the Mississippi, opposite the place.</p>

<p>We found the garrison to consist of a single company of
infantry, under the command of Capt. J. Fowle, Jun.,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[107]</a> who received
us courteously, and offered the salute due to the rank of
His Excellency, Gov. Cass. The fort is a square stockade, with
bastions at two angles. There was found on this part of the
prairie, when it came to be occupied with a garrison by the Americans,
in 1819, an ancient platform-mound, in an exactly square
form, the shape and outlines of which were preserved with exactitude
by the prairie sod. This earthwork, the probable evidence
of a condition of ancient society, arts, and events of a race who
are now reduced so low, was, with good taste, preserved by the
military, when they erected this stockade. One of the officers
built a dwelling-house upon it, thus converting it, to the use, and
probably the only use, to which it was originally devoted. No
measurements have been preserved of its original condition; but
judging from present appearances, it must have squared seventy-five
feet, and have had an elevation of eight feet.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Mr. Schoolcraft makes a visit to the lead mines of Dubuque&mdash;Incidents of the trip&mdash;Description
of the mines&mdash;The title of occupancy, and the mode of the mines
being worked by the Fox tribe of Indians&mdash;Who are the Foxes?</p>

<p>I solicited permission of Gov. Cass to visit the lead mines of
Dubuque, which are situated on the west bank of the Mississippi,
at the computed distance of twenty-five leagues below Prairie du
Chien. Furnished with a light canoe, manned by eight voyageurs,
including a guide, I left the prairie at half past eleven
A. M. (6th). Passed the entrance of the Wisconsin, on the left
bank, at the distance of a league.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[108]</a> Opposite this point is the
high elevation which Pike, in 1806, recommended to be occupied
with a military work. The suggestion has not, however, been
adopted; military men, probably, thinking that, however eligible
the site might be for a work where civilized nations were likely
to come into contact, a simpler style of defensive works would
serve the purpose of keeping the Indian tribes in check. I proceeded
nine leagues below, and encamped at the site of a Fox
village,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[109]</a> located on the east bank, a mile below the entrance of
Turkey River from the west. The village, consisting of twelve
lodges, was now temporarily deserted, the Indians being probably
absent on a hunt; but, if so, it was remarkable that not a soul or
living thing was left behind, not even a dog. My guide, indeed,
informed me that the cause of the desertion was the fears entertained
of an attack from the Sioux, in retaliation for the massacre
lately perpetrated by them on the heads of the St. Peter's, which
was alluded to in the speech of the Little Crow, while we were at
his village (<i>ante</i>, p. 160).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
It was seven o'clock P. M. when I landed here, and having
some hours of daylight, I walked back from the river to look at
the village, and its fields, and to examine the geological structure
of the adjacent cliffs. In their gardens I observed squashes,
beans, and pumpkins, but the fields of corn, the principal article
of cultivation, had been nearly all destroyed, probably by wild
animals. I found an extensive field of water and musk melons,
situated in an opening in a grove, detached from the other fields
and gardens. None of the fruit was perfectly ripe, although it
had been found so at Prairie du Chien; some of it had been bitten
by wild animals.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[110]</a> The cliffs consisted of the same horizontal
strata of sandstones and neutral colored limestone, prevailing at
higher positions in this valley. Returning to the river beach, I
perceived the same pebble drift which characterizes higher latitudes.
This seems the only difference in its structure or form,
namely, that the pieces of quartz pebble, limestone, and other
fragments brought down, become smaller and smaller, as they are
carried down.</p>

<p>There were frequent thunders, and a rain-storm, during the
night, which, with a slight intermission, characterized the morning
until noon. I embarked at half past three A. M. (7th), and
landed at the Fox village of the Kettle chief, at the site of
Dubuque's house,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[111]</a> at ten o'clock; a moderate rain having continued
all the way. It ceased an hour after my arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
The Kettle chief's village is situated fifteen miles below the
entrance of the Little Makokety River, consisting of nineteen
lodges, built in two rows, pretty compact, and having a population
of two hundred and fifty souls. There is a large island in
the Mississippi, directly opposite this village, which is occupied
by traders. I first landed there to get an interpreter of the Fox
language, and obtain some necessary information respecting the
location of the mines, and the best means of accomplishing my
object. Meantime the rain had ceased. I then proceeded across
the Mississippi to the Kettle chief's lodge, to solicit his permission
to visit the mines, and obtain Indian guides. I succeeded in getting
Mr. Gates, as interpreter; and was accompanied by Dr. S. Muir, a
trader, who politely offered to go with me. On entering the lodge
of Aquoqua, the chief, I found him suffering under a severe attack
of bilious fever. As I approached him, he sat upon his pallet,
being unable to stand, and bid me welcome; but soon became
exhausted by the labor of conversation, and was obliged to resume
his former position. He appeared to be a man of eighty
years of age, had a venerable look, but was reduced to the last
stage of physical debility. Yet he retained his faculties of sight
and hearing unimpaired, together with his mental powers. He
spoke to me of his death with calm resignation, as a thing to be
desired. On stating the object of my visit, some objections were
made by the chiefs who surrounded him, and they required further
time to consider the proposition. In the mean time, I learned
from another source, that since the death of Dubuque, to whom
the Indians had formerly granted the privilege of working the
mines, they had manifested great jealousy of the whites, were
afraid they would encroach on their rights, denied all former
grants, and did not make it a practice even to allow strangers to
view their diggings. Apprehending some difficulties of this
kind, I had provided myself with some presents, and concluding
this to be the time, because of the reluctance manifested, directed
one of my voyageurs to bring in a present of tobacco and whiskey;
and in a few moments I received their assent, and two guides
were furnished. One of these was a minor chief, called Scabass,
or the Yelling Wolf; the other, Wa-ba-say-ah, or the White Foxskin.
They led me up the cliff, where I understood the Indian
woman, Peosta, first found lead ore; after reaching the level of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the river bluffs, we pursued a path over undulating hills, exhibiting
a half prairie, and quite picturesque rural aspect. On reaching
the diggings, the most striking part of them, but not all of
them, exhibited excavations such as the Indians only do not seem
persevering enough in labor to have made.</p>

<p>The district of country called Dubuque's Mines, embraces an
area of about twenty-one square leagues, commencing at the
mouth of the Little Maquaquity River, sixty miles below Prairie
du Chien, and extending along the west bank of the Mississippi
River, seven leagues in front by three in depth. The principal
mines are situated on a tract of one square league, beginning immediately
at the Fox village of Aquoqua, or the Kettle chief,
and extending westwardly. This is the seat of the mining operations
carried on by Dubuque, as well as of what are called the
Indian Diggings.</p>

<p>Geologically it is the same formation that characterizes the
mines of Missouri; but there are some peculiarities. The ore
found is the common sulphuret of lead, with a broad foliated,
or lamellated structure, and high metallic lustre. It occurs
massive and disseminated, in a red loam, resting on a horizontal
limestone rock. Sometimes small veins of the ore are
seen in the rock, but it has been generally explored in the soil.
It generally occurs in narrow beds, which have a fixed direction;
these beds extend three or four hundred feet, when they cease,
or are traced into crevices in the rock. At this stage, the pursuit
of ore, at most of the diggings, has been abandoned, frequently
with small veins of the metal in view. No matrix, so
far as I observed, is found with the ore which is dug out of the
soil, unless we may consider such an ochery oxide of iron, with
which it is slightly incrusted. Occasionally, pieces of calcareous
spar are thrown out with the earth in digging after ore. I picked
up from one of these heaps of earth a specimen of transparent crystallized
sulphate of barytes; but this mineral appears to be rare.
There appears to be none of the radiated quartz, or white opaque
heavy spar, which are so abundantly found at the Missouri
mines.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[112]</a></p>

<p>The ore at these mines is now exclusively dug by the Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>women. Old and superannuated men also partake in the mining
labor, but the warriors and men hold themselves above it. In
this labor, the persons who engage in it employ the hoe, shovel,
pick-axe, and crow-bar. These implements are supplied by the
traders at the island, who are the purchasers of the crude ore.
With these implements they dig trenches, till they are arrested
by the solid rock. There are no shafts, even of the simplest kind,
and the windlass and bucket are unknown to them&mdash;far more so
the use of gunpowder in the mining operations. Their mode of
going down into the deepest pits, and coming up from them, is
by digging an inclined way, which permits the women to keep
an erect position in walking.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[113]</a> I descended into one of these
inclined excavations, which had probably been carried down
forty feet, at the perpendicular angle.</p>

<p>When a quantity of ore has been got out, it is carried in
baskets to the banks of the Mississippi, by the females, who are
ferried over to the island. They receive at the rate of two dollars
for a hundred and twenty pounds, payable in goods. At the
profit at which these are usually sold, it may be presumed to
cost the traders at the rate of seventy-five cents or a dollar, cash
value, per hundred weight. The traders smelt the ore on the
island, in furnaces of the same construction which I have described,
and given plates of, in my treatise on the mines.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[114]</a> They
observe that it yields the same per centum of metallic lead.
Formerly, the Indians were in the habit of smelting the ore
themselves on log heaps, by which an unusual proportion of it
was converted into lead-ashes and lost. They are now induced
to search about the sites of these old fires to collect these lead-ashes,
which consist, for the most part, of desulphuretted ore, for
which they receive a dollar per bushel.</p>

<p>There are three mines in addition to those above mentioned,
situated upon the Upper Mississippi, which are worked by the
Indians. They are located at Sinsinaway, at Rivière au Fevre,
and at the Little Makokety. 1. Sinsinaway mines. They are
situated fifteen miles below Aquoqua's Village, on the east shore
of the Mississippi, at the junction of the Sinsinaway River. 2.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Mine au Fevre. Situated on the River au Fevre, which enters
the Mississippi on its east banks, twenty-one miles below Dubuque's
mines. The lead ore is found ten miles from its mouth.
At this locality, the ore is accompanied by the sulphate of barytes,
and is sometimes crystallized in cubes or octohedrons.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[115]</a> 3.
Mine of the Makokety, or Maquoqueti. This small river enters
the Mississippi fifteen miles above Dubuque's mines. The mineral
character and value of the country has been but little explored.</p>

<p>The history of the mines of Dubuque is brief and simple. In
1780, a discovery of lead ore was made by the wife of Peosta, a
Fox Indian of Aquoqua's Village. This gave the hint for explorations,
which resulted in extensive discoveries. The lands
were formally granted by the Indians to Julien Dubuque, at a
council held at Prairie du Chien in 1788, by virtue of which he
permanently settled on them, erected buildings and furnaces, and
continued to work them until 1810. In 1796, he received a confirmation
of his grant from Carondelet, the governor of Louisiana,
in which they are called "the mines of Spain." By a stone monument
which stands on a hill near the mines, Dubuque died on the
24th March, 1810, aged forty-five years and six months. After his
death, the Indians burnt down his house and fences&mdash;he leaving,
I believe, no family<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[116]</a>&mdash;and erased every vestige of civilized life;
and they have since revoked, or at least denied the grant, and
appear to set a very high value on the mines. Dubuque's claim
was assigned to his creditors, by whom it was presented to the
commissioners for deciding on land titles, in 1806. By a majority
of the board it was determined to be valid, in which condition it
was reported to Washington for final action. At this stage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>the investigation, Mr. Gallatin, who was then Secretary of the
Treasury, made a report on the subject, clearly stating the facts,
and coming to the conclusion that it was not a perfect title,
stating that no patent had ever been issued for it, at New Orleans,
the seat of the Spanish authority, from which transcripts of the
records of all grants had been transmitted to the Treasury.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[117]</a></p>

<p>On the arrival of Lieut. Pike at Mr. Dubuque's on the 1st of
September, 1805, he endeavored to obtain information necessary
to judge of the value and extent and the nature of the grant of
the mines; but he was not able to visit them. To the inquiries
which he addressed to Mr. Dubuque on the subject, the latter
replied in writing that a copy of the grant was filed at the proper
office in St. Louis, which would show its date, together with the
date of its confirmation by the Spanish authority, and the extent
of the grant to him. He states the mine to be twenty-seven or
twenty-eight leagues long, and from one to three leagues broad.
He represents the per centum of metal to be yielded from the
ore to be seventy-five, and the quantity smelted per annum at
from 20,000 to 40,000 pounds. He stated that the whole product
was cast into pig lead, and that there were no other metals at the
mines but copper, of the value of which he could not judge.</p>

<p>Having examined the mines with as much minuteness as the
time allowed me would permit, and obtained specimens of its
ores and minerals, I returned to the banks of the Mississippi,
before the daylight departed, and, immediately embarking, went
up the river two leagues and encamped on an island.</p>

<p>It may be proper to add to this narrative of my mineralogical
visit to these mines, a few words respecting the Fox Indians, by
whom the country is owned. The first we hear of these people
is from early missionaries of New France, who call them, in a
list drawn up for the government in 1736, "Gens du Sang," and
Miskaukis. The latter I found to be the name they apply to themselves.
We get nothing, however, by it. It means Red-earths,
being a compound from <i>misk-wau</i>, red, and <i>auki</i>, earth. They
are a branch of the great Algonquin family. The French, who
formed a bad opinion of them, as their history opened, bestowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>on them the name of Renouard, from which we derive their long-standing
popular name. Their traditions attribute their origin
to eastern portions of America. Mr. Gates, who acted as my
interpreter, and is well acquainted with their language and customs,
informs me that their traditions refer to their residence on
the north banks of the St. Lawrence, near the ancient Cataraqui.
They appear to have been a very erratic, spirited, warlike, and
treacherous tribe; dwelling but a short time at a spot, and pushing
westward, as their affairs led them, till they finally reached
the Mississippi, which they must have crossed after 1766, for
Carver found them living in villages on the Wisconsin. At
Saginaw, they appear to have formed a fast alliance with the
Saucs, a tribe to whom they are closely allied by language and
history. They figure in the history of Indian events about old
Michilimackinac, where they played pranks under the not very
definite title of Muscodainsug, but are first conspicuously noted
while they dwelt on the river bearing their name, which falls into
Green Bay, Wisconsin.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[118]</a> The Chippewas, with whom they have
strong affinity of language, call them Otagami, and ever deemed
them a sanguinary and unreliable tribe. The French defeated
them in a sanguinary battle at Butte de Mort, and by this defeat
drove them from Fox River.</p>

<p>Their present numbers cannot be accurately given. I was informed
that the village I visited contained two hundred and fifty
souls. They have a large village at Rock Island, where the
Foxes and Saucs live together, which consists of sixty lodges,
and numbers three hundred souls. One-half of these may be
Saucs. They have another village at the mouth of Turkey
River; altogether, they may muster from 460 to 500 souls. Yet,
they are at war with most of the tribes around them, except the
Iowas, Saucs, and Kickapoos. They are engaged in a deadly,
and apparently successful war against the Sioux tribes. They
recently killed nine men of that nation, on the Terre Blue River;
and a party of twenty men are now absent, in the same direction,
under a half-breed named Morgan. They are on bad terms with
the Osages and Pawnees of the Missouri, and not on the best
terms with their neighbors the Winnebagoes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>I again embarked at four o'clock A. M. (8th). My men were
stout fellows, and worked with hearty will, and it was thought
possible to reach the Prairie during the day, by hard and late
pushing. We passed Turkey River at two o'clock, and they
boldly plied their paddles, sometimes animating their labors with
a song; but the Mississippi proved too stout for us; and some
time after nightfall we put ashore on an island, before reaching
the Wisconsin. In ascending the river this day, observed the
pelican, which exhibited itself in a flock, standing on a low sandy
spot of an island. This bird has a clumsy and unwieldy look,
from the duplicate membrane attached to its lower mandible,
which is constructed so as when inflated to give it a bag-like appearance.
A short sleep served to restore the men, and we were
again in our canoes the next morning (9th) before I could certainly
tell the time by my watch. Daylight had not yet broke
when we passed the influx of the Wisconsin, and we reached the
Prairie under a full chorus, and landed at six o'clock.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">The expedition proceeds from Prairie du Chein up the Wisconsin Valley&mdash;Incidents
of the ascent&mdash;Etymology of the name&mdash;The low state of its waters favorable to
the observation of its fresh-water conchology&mdash;Cross the Wisconsin summit, and
descend the Fox River to Winnebago Lake.</p>

<p>We were now at the foot of the Wisconsin Valley&mdash;at the
point, in fact, where Marquette and Joliet, coming from the
forests and lakes of New France, had discovered the great River
of the West, in 1673. Marquette, led by his rubrics, named it
the River "Conception," but, in his journal, he freely employs the
aboriginal term of Mississippi, which was in use by the whole
body of the Algonquin tribes. While awaiting, at Prairie du
Chein, the preparations for ascending the Wisconsin, the locality
was found a very remarkable one for its large unios, and some
other species of fresh-water shells. Some specimens of the unio
crassus, found on the shores of the island in the Mississippi,
opposite the village, were of thrice the size of any noticed in
America or Europe, and put conchologists in doubt whether
the species should not be named <i>giganteus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[119]</a> I had, in coming
down the Mississippi, procured some fine and large specimens of
the unio purpureus of Mr. Say, at the Painted Rock, with some
other species; and the discovery of such large species of the
crassus served to direct new attention to the subject.</p>

<p>Our sympathies were excited, at this place, by observing an
object of human deformity in the person of an Indian, who, to
remedy the want of the power of locomotion, had adjusted his
legs in a large wooden bowl. By rocking this on the ground, he
supplied, in a manner, the lost locomotive power. This man of
the bowl possessed his faculties of mind unimpaired, spoke seve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>ral
Indian languages, besides the Canadian French, and appeared
cheerful and intelligent. An excursion into the adjacent country,
to view some caves, and a reported mineral locality made by
Mr. Trowbridge, during my descent to the mines of Dubuque,
brought me some concretions of carbonate of lime, but the Indian
guides either faltered to make the promised discoveries, through
their superstitions, or really failed in the effort to find the object.
By tracing the shores of the Mississippi, I found the rolled and
hard agates and other quartz species, which characterize the
pebble-drift of its sources, still present in the down-flowing shore-drift.</p>

<p>The aboriginal name of this place is Kipesági, an Algonquin
word, which is applied to the mouth or outflow of the Wisconsin
River. It appears to be based on the verb <i>kipa</i>, to be thick or
turbid, and <i>sauge</i>, outflow&mdash;the river at its floods, being but little
else than a moving mass of sand and water.</p>

<p>It was the 9th (Aug.) at half-past ten in the morning before
the expedition left the Prairie to ascend the Wisconsin, the mouth
of which we reached after descending the Mississippi three miles.
This is an impressive scene&mdash;the bold cliffs of the west bank of
the Mississippi, with Pike's-hill rising in front on the west, while
those of the Wisconsin Valley stand at but little less elevation
on the north and south. At this season of the year the water is
clear and placid, and mingles itself in its mighty recipient without
disturbance. But it is easy to conceive, what the Indians affirm,
that in its floods it is a strong and turbid mass of moving waters,
against which nothing can stand. This character of the stream is
believed, indeed, to be the origin of the Indian name of Wisconsin.
Miskawägumi, means a strong or mixed water, or liquid. By adding
to this word <i>totoshabo</i> (milk), the meaning is coagulated or turning
milk; it is often used to mean brandy, which is then called
strong water; by adding <i>iscodawabo</i>, the meaning is fire-water.
Marquette, in 1673, spells the name of the river indifferently
Meshkousing, and Mishkousing. Of this term, the inflection <i>ing</i>,
is simply a local form, the letter <i>s</i> being thrown in for euphony.
This word appears to be a derivation from the term <i>mushkowa</i>,
strong water. By admitting the transmutation of <i>m</i> to <i>w</i>, the
initial syllable <i>mis</i> is changed to <i>wis</i>, and the interpretation is then
river (or place) of strong waters. The term of <i>kipesagi</i>, applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to its mouth, is but another characteristic feature of it&mdash;the one
laying stress on its <i>turbidity in flood</i>, and the other on its <i>strength
of current</i>. These are certainly the two leading traits of the Wisconsin,
which rushes with a great average velocity over an inclined
plane, without falls, for a great distance. It originates in
a remarkable summit of sandy plains, which send out to the west
the Chippewa River of Lake Pepin, to the north the Montreal
and Ontonagon of Lake Superior, and to the east the Menomonee
of Green Bay, while the Wisconsin becomes its southern off-drain,
till it finally turns west at the Portage, and flows into the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>We ascended, the first day, eighteen miles; the next, thirty-six;
the third day, thirty-four miles; the fourth, forty; the fifth,
thirty-eight, and the sixth, sixteen, which brought us to the Fox
and Wisconsin Portage, a spot renowned from the earliest French
days of western discovery. For here, on the waters separating
the Mississippi from the great lakes, there had, at successive
intervals, been pitched the tents of Marquette, La Hontan, Carver,
and other explorers, who have, in their published journals, left
traces of their footsteps. La Salle, who excelled them all in
energy of character, proceeded to the Mississippi from Lake
Michigan, down the Illinois.</p>

<p>Our estimates made the distance from the Mississippi to this
point one hundred and eighty-two miles. It is a wide, and (at
this season) shallow stream, with transparent waters, running over
a bed of yellow sand, checkered with numerous small islands,
and long spits of sand-bars. There is not a fall in this distance,
and it must be navigable with large craft during the periodical
freshets. It receives the Blue, Pine, and other tributaries in this
distance. Its valley presents a geological section, on a large
scale, of the series of lead-bearing rocks extending in regular
succession from the fundamental sandstone to the topmost limestones.
The water being shallow and warm, we often waded
from bar to bar, and found the scene a fruitful one for its fresh-water
conchology. The Indians frequently amused me by
accounts of the lead mines and mineral productions of its borders;
but I followed them in this search only to be convinced that
they were without sincerity in these representations, and had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>higher objects on this head, than, by assuming a conciliatory manner,
to secure temporary advantages while the expedition was
passing through their country. The valley belongs to the Winnebagoes,
whom we frequently met, and received a friendly reception
from. We also encountered Menomonies, who occupy the
lower part of the adjacent Fox River Valley, but rove widely west
and north over the countries of the tribes they are at peace with.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin Valley was formerly inhabited by the Sacs and
Foxes, who raised large quantities of corn and beans on its fertile
shores. They were driven by the French, in alliance with
the Chippewas and Menomonies. It is now possessed exclusively
by the Winnebagoes, a savage and bloodthirsty tribe, who came,
according to tradition, many years ago from the south, and are
thought to be related to some of the Mexican tribes. Their language
is cognate with the great Sioux or Dakota stock west of
the Mississippi, who likewise date their origin south. To those
accustomed to hear the softer tones of the Chippewa and Algonquin,
it sounds harsh and guttural. Their name for themselves
is Hochungara; the French call them <i>Puants</i>.</p>

<p>In passing up this valley, an almost never-failing object of
interest was furnished by the univalve shells found along its
banks, and by the variety in size, shape, and color which they
exhibited. Of these, the late Mr. Barnes has described, from my
duplicates, the U. plicatus, U. verrucosus, U. ventricosus, U. planus,
U. obliqua, and U. gracilis.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[120]</a> We frequently observed the
scolipax minor, the plover, the A. alcyon, a small yellow bird,
and C. vociferus, along its sandy shores; and, in other positions,
the brant, the grouse, the A. sponsa, and the summer duck, and
F. melodia. A range of hills extends from the Mississippi, on each
shore, to within twenty miles of the Portage, where it ceases, on
the south side, but continues on the north&mdash;receding, however, a
considerable distance. This section is called the Highlands of
the Wisconsin. The stratification is exclusively sandstone and
limestone, in the usual order of the metalliferous series of the
West, and lying in horizontal positions.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of rattlesnake in the Valley of the Wisconsin.
The larger, or barred crotalis, is confined to the hills,
and attains a large size. I killed one of this species at the mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>of a small cave on the summit of a cliff to which I ascended,
which measured four feet in length, and had nine rattles. Its
great thickness attracted notice. Attaching a twig to its neck, I
drew it down into the valley as a present to our Indians, knowing
that they regard the reptile in a peculiar manner. They
found it a female, having eleven young, who had taken shelter
in their maternal abdominal-covering. The Ottowas carefully
took off the skin, and brought it with them. The second kind
of this reptile is called prairie rattlesnake, is confined to the
plains, and does not exceed fifteen or twenty inches in length.</p>

<p>The Indians had reported localities of lead, copper, and silver
at various places, but always failed, as we ascended, to reveal
anything of more value than detached pieces of sulphuret of iron,
or brown iron-stone. When we reached the portage, a Winnebago,
who had been the chief person in making these reports,
came with great ceremony to present a specimen of his reported
silver. On taking off the envelop it turned out to be a small
mass of light-colored glistening folia of mica. We had found the
horizontal rocks along the stream thus far, but the primitive
shows itself, within a mile north of the portage, in orbicular
masses in situ, coming through the prairies.</p>

<p>Having reached the summit, we proceeded across it to the
banks of Fox River, where we encamped. It consists of a level
plain. The distance is a mile and a half. It required, however,
some time to have our baggage and canoes transported, which
was done by a Frenchman residing at this summit. Such is the
slight difference in the level of the two rivers, that Indian canoes
are pushed through the marshy ridges when the rivers are swelled
by freshets. It was half-past three o'clock of the 15th, the day
following our arrival, before the transportation and loading of
our canoes was completed. It was then necessary to push our
canoes through fields of rushes and other aquatic plants, through
which the river winds. This was a slow mode of progress, and
we spent the remainder of the day in passing fifteen miles, which
brought us to the <span class="smcap">FORKS</span>, so called, where the northern unites
with the southern branch of the river. At this spot we encamped.
Next day we estimated our descent at sixty-three miles, having
found the navigation less intricate and obstructed from the aquatic
growth. In this distance we passed, at thirty miles below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
fork, a piece of clear water of nine miles extent, called Buffalo
Lake; and at the distance of twelve miles lower, another lake of
some twelve miles in extent, called Puckaway Lake. Down to
this point, the Fox River has scarcely a perceptible current. We
found we had not only, in parting from the Wisconsin to the Fox,
exchanged an open, swift, and strong flowing current, for a very
quiet and still one, winding through areas of wild rice and the
whole family of water plants; but had intruded into a region of
water-fowl and birds of every plumage, who, as they rioted upon
their cherished zizania aquatica, made the air resound with their
screams. The blackbird appeared to be lord of these fields. We
had also intruded upon a favorite region of the water-snake, who,
coiled up on his bed of plants at every bend of the stream, slid
off with spiteful glance into the stream. In passing these places
of habitation, which the Chippewas call <i>wauzh</i>, we perceptibly
smelt an unpleasant odor arising from it.</p>

<p>The next day we descended the river seventy miles. There is
a perceptible current below Puckaway Lake. The river increases
in width and depth, and offers no impediment whatever to its
navigation. Fox River runs, indeed, from the portage to Winnebago
Lake on a summit, over which it winds among sylvan hills,
covered with grass and prairie-flowers, interspersed with groves
of oak, elm, ash, and hickory, and dotted at intervals with lakes
of refreshing transparent water. The height of this summit,
above the Mississippi and the lakes, must be several hundred
feet (stated at 234), which permits the stream to flow with liveliness,
insuring, when it comes to be settled,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[121]</a> the erection of
hydraulic works; and it would be difficult to point to a region
possessing in its soil, climate, and natural resources, a more favorable
character for an agricultural population. It has a diversified
surface, without mountains; a fine dry atmosphere; an admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>drainage east, west, north, and south, and a ready access to the
great oceanic marts through the Great Lake and the Mississippi.</p>

<p>We passed, this day, several encampments and villages of Winnebagoes
and Menomonies&mdash;tribes, who, with the erratic habits of
the Tartars, or Bedouins, once spread their tents in the Fox and
Wisconsin valleys, but have now (1853) relinquished them to the
European race; and it does not, at this distance of time, seem important
to denote the particular spots where they once boiled
their kettles of corn, or thumped their magic drums. God have
mercy on them in their wild wanderings! We also passed the
entrance of Wolf River, a fine bold stream on the left; and soon
below it the handsome elevation of La Butte de Morts, or the
Hillock of the Dead. This eminence was covered by the frail
lodges of the Winnebagoes. The spot is memorable in Indian
history, for a signal defeat of the Foxes, by the French and their
Indian allies in the seventeenth century, after which, this tribe was
finally expelled from the Fox valley. Our night's encampment
(17th) was below this spot. The night air was remarkably cold, and
put an end to our further annoyance from mosquitos. We embarked
at five o'clock the next morning during a dense fog, which
was in due time dissipated by the rising sun. We had been five
hours in our canoes, under the full force of paddles, when we
entered Winnebago Lake. This is a most beautiful and sylvan
expanse of water some twenty-four miles long by ten in width,
surrounded by picturesque prairie and sloping plains. It has a
stream at Fond du Lac, its southern extremity,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[122]</a> which is connected
by a short portage with the principal source of Rock River
of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The Fox River, after having displayed itself in the lake, leaves
it, at its northern extremity, flowing by a succession of rapids
and falls over horizontal limestones to the head of Green Bay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>There is a Winnebago village, under Hoo Tshoop, or Four Legs,
at the point of outlet, where we landed, and as the first rapid
begins at that point, creating a delay, I took the occasion to examine
its geology more closely, by procuring fresh fractures of the
masses of rock in the vicinity. This process, it appeared, was
narrowly watched by the Indians, who wondered what such a
scrutiny should mean. The French, said the chief to one of
our interpreters, formerly held possession of this country; and,
afterwards, came the British. They contented themselves with
common things, and never disturbed these rocks, which have
been laying here forever. But the moment the Americans get
possession of the country, they must come and knock off pieces
of the rock, and look at them. It is marvellous!</p>

<p>A brilliant mass of native copper, weighing ten or twelve
pounds, was found by an Indian, some years ago, on the shores
of this lake. The moment he espied it, his imagination was fired,
and he fancied he beheld the form of a beautiful female, standing
in the water. Glittering in radiancy, she held out in her hand
a lump of gold. He paddled his canoe towards her, furtively
and slow, but, as he advanced, a transformation gradually ensued.
Her eyes lost their brilliancy, her face the glow of life and health,
her arms disappeared; and when he reached the spot, the object
had changed into a stone monument of the human form, with the
tail of a fish. Amazed, he sat awhile in silence; then, lighting his
pipe, he offered it the incense of tobacco, and addressed it, as the
guardian angel of his country. Lifting the miraculous image
gently into his canoe, he took his seat, with his face in an opposite
direction, and paddled towards shore, on reaching which, and
turning round to the object of his regard, he discovered, in its
place, nothing but a lump of shining virgin copper.</p>

<p>Such are the imaginative efforts of this race, who look to the
eyes of civilization as if they had themselves faces of stone, and
hearts of adamant.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Descent of the Fox River from Winnebago Lake to Green Bay&mdash;Incidents&mdash;Etymology,
conchology, mineralogy&mdash;Falls of the Konomic and Kakala&mdash;Population
and antiquity of the settlement of Green Bay&mdash;Appearances of a tide, not
sustained.</p>

<p>A rapid commences at the precise point where Fox River
issues from Winnebago Lake. This rapid, down which canoes
descend with half loads, extends a mile and a half, when the river
assumes its usual navigable form, presenting a noble volume.
Nine miles below this, a ledge of the semi-crystalline limestone
rock crosses the entire channel, lifting itself five feet above the bed
of the stream. Over this the Fox River throws itself by an abrupt
cascade. Down this shelf of rock, the canoes, previously lightened
of their burden, are lifted by the men. It was sometime after
dark when we reached and encamped on the north shore, at the
foot of this cascade, which bears the name of Konamik. The
syllable <i>kon</i>, in this word, appears to me to be the same as <i>con</i>
in Wisconsin, and is, apparently, a derivative from a term for
strong water, which has, in this case, the meaning of cascade or
fall. The word <i>amik</i>, its terminal, means a beaver. We thus
have the probable original meaning in beaver-water, or, by implication,
beaver cascade. There is a rapid below this fall. I
judged the water must sink its level, in this vicinity, about fifteen
feet. On examining the character of the limestone, I discovered
crystals of calcareous spar occupying small cavities. At other
localities, at lower points, there were found crystals of black sulphuret
of zinc, and yellow sulphuret of iron. The rock appears
to be of the same age as the lead-bearing limestone of the West;
it is also overlaid by the red marly clay, and I should judge it to
contain deposits of sulphuret of lead.</p>

<p>The next morning, we resumed our descent of the Fox River<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with difficulty. It was now the 19th of August, and the waters
had reached their lowest summer stage. The entire distance of
twelve miles from the Konamik to the Kákala fall may be deemed
to be, at this season, a continuous rapid. Our barge was abandoned
on the rapids. While the men toiled in these rapids to
get down their canoes, it was found rather a privilege to walk,
for it gave a more ample opportunity to examine the mineral
structure and productions of the country.</p>

<p>It was high noon when we reached the rapids of the Kákala.
This is a formidable rapid, at which the river rushes with furious
velocity down a rocky bed, which it seems impossible boats or
canoes should ever safely descend. It demands a portage to be
made, under all circumstances, the water sweeping round a curve
or bow, of which the portage path is the string. This is the
apparent meaning of the term, in the Indian tongue; but it is disguised
by early orthography, in which the letter <i>l</i> has taken the
place of <i>n</i>, and the syllable <i>in</i> of <i>au</i>. The term <i>kakina</i> is the
ancient French form of the Indian transitive-adjective <i>all</i>, inclusive,
entirely. There is another root for the term in <i>kakiwa</i>,
which is the ordinary term for a portage, or walk across a point
of land, which is rendered local by the usual inflection, <i>o-nong</i>.</p>

<p>We found the portage path to be a well-beaten wagon road
across a level fertile plain, which appeared to have been in cultivation
from the earliest Indian period. Probably it had been a
locality for the tribes, where they raised their favorite maize, long
before the French first reached the waters of Green Bay. Evidence
of such antiquity in the plain of Kákala appeared in an
ancient cemetery of a circular shape, situated on one side of the
road, on a comparatively large surface, which had reached the
height of some eight or ten feet, by the mere accumulation of
graves. This has all the appearance of a sepulchral mound, in
the slow process of construction; for, on viewing it, I found a
recent grave. We passed, on this plain, a Winnebago village of
ten or twelve lodges, embracing two hundred souls. The portage
is continued just one mile. Embarking again, at this point, we
proceeded down the river, and encamped eight miles below this
point, having, with every exertion, made but twenty miles this
day.</p>

<p>The interest which had been excited by the conchology of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Mississippi and Wisconsin valleys, was renewed in the descent of
the Fox River, particularly in the section of it below Winnebago
Lake. Shrunk to its lowest summer level, its shores disclosed
almost innumerable species of unios, many of which had been
manifestly dragged to the shores and opened by the muskrat,
thus serving to give hints for finding the living species. Among
these, the U. obliqua, U. cornutus, U. ellipticus, U. carinatus, U.
Alatus, U. prælongus, and U. parvus, were conspicuous; the latter
of which, it is remarked by Mr. Barnes, is the smallest and most
beautiful of all the genus yet discovered in America.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[123]</a> In the
duplicates, from this part of the Fox River, transmitted to Mr.
Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, he found a species with green-rayed
beaks, on a yellow surface and iridescent nacre, having a peculiar
structure, which he did me the honor to name after me.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[124]</a> The
description of Mr. Lea is as follows: "Unio Schoolcraftensis.
Shell subrotund, somewhat angular at posterior dorsal margin,
nearly equilateral, compressed, slightly tuberculate posteriorly to
umbonical slope. Substance of the shell rather thick; beaks elevated;
ligament short; epidermis smooth yellow, with several
broad green rays; teeth elevated, and cleft in the left valve, single,
and rising from a pit in the right; lateral teeth elevated, straight,
and lamellar; anterior cicatrices distinct, posterior cicatrices
confluent; dorsal cicatrices within the cavity of the shell on the
base of the cardinal tooth; cavity of the beaks angular and deep;
nacre pearly white and iridescent. Diameter ·7, length 1·1,
breadth 1·3 inches."</p>

<p>The next morning (20th), a heavy fog in the Fox Valley detained
us in our encampment till 7 o'clock. Six miles brought
us to another rapid, called the Little Kakala, which, however,
opposes no obstacle to the descent of canoes. At this spot, which
is the apparent western terminus of the Bay settlement, we found
a party of U. S. soldiers, from Fort Howard, engaged in digging
the foundations for a saw-mill. Our appearance must have been
somewhat rusty at this time, from our deficiences in the tonsorial
and sempstrescal way, for these sons of Mars did not recognize
their superior officers in Capt. Douglass and Lt. Mackay; glibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>saying, in a jolly way, as they handed them a drink of water:
"After me, sir, is manners;" and drinking off the first cup. At this
rapid I got out of my canoe, wishing to see the geological formation
more fully, and walked quite to the Rapide du Pere, where
Fox River finds its level in the broad, elongated, and lake-like
tongue of water, extending up from the head of Green Bay. On
reaching this point, the scene of the settlement first burst on our
view, with its farm-houses and cultivated fields stretching, for
five miles, along both banks of the river; disclosing the flagstaff
of the distant fort, and the bannered masts of vessels, all of which
brought vividly to mind our approach to the civilized world. If
the Canadian boat-song was ever exhilarating and appropriate, it
was peculiarly so on the present occasion; and when our <i>voyageurs</i>
burst out, in full chorus, with the ancient ditty, beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>La fille du Roi son vout chassau,</i></p>
<p><i>Avec son grande fusee d'largent</i>,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>they waked up a responsive feeling, not alone in the breasts of
the French <i>habitans</i>, lining the shores of the river, but in our
own breasts. On reaching the fort, the salute due to the governor
of a territory was paid, in honor of our leader, Governor
Cass; and in exchanging congratulations with the officers and
citizens, we began first to feel, in reality, that, after passing among
many savage tribes, our scalps were still safely on our heads. I
found, at the fort, letters from my friends, and was thus reminded
that warm sympathies had been alive for our fate. Weary regions
had now been past, and privations endured, of which we thought
little, at the time; the flag of the Union had been carried among
barbarous tribes, who hardly knew there was such a power as the
United States, or, if they knew, despised it; and some information
had been gathered, which it was hoped would enlarge the
boundaries of science, and would at the same time send a thrill of
satisfaction, and impart a feeling of security, along the whole line
of the advanced and extended western settlements. If Berkeley,
in the dark days of the Commonwealth of England, could turn to
the West, with exultation, as the hope of the nation, it must be
admitted that it is by some out-door means, like this, that the way
for the car of "empire" must be prepared.</p>

<p>We found the fort, which bears the name of Howard, in charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of Capt. W. Wistler, during the absence of Col. Joseph L. Smith.
Its strength consists of three hundred men, together with about
the same number of infantry at Camp Smith, at Rock or Dupere
Rapid, a few miles above, who are engaged in quarrying stone for
a permanent fortification at that point. On visiting this quarry,
I found it to consist of a bluish-gray limestone, semi-crystalline in
its structure, containing small disseminated masses of sulphuret
of zinc, calcspar, and iron pyrites, and corresponding, in every
respect, with the beds of this rock observed along the upper parts
of the Fox and Wisconsin valleys.</p>

<p>Fort Howard is seated on a handsome fertile plain, on the north
banks of the Fox, near its mouth. It consists of a stockade of
timber, thirty feet high, inclosing barracks, which face three sides
of a quadrangle. This forms a fine parade. There are blockhouses,
mounting guns, at the angles, and quarters for the surgeon
and quartermaster, separately constructed. The whole is
whitewashed, and presents a neat military appearance. The
gardens of the military denote the most fruitful soil and genial
climate. Data observed by the surgeon, indicate the site to be
unexcelled for its salubrity, such a disease as fever, of any kind,
never having visited it, in either an endemic or epidemic form.</p>

<p>The name of Green Bay is associated with our earliest ideas of
French history in America. When La Salle visited the country
in the 17th century, it had been many years known to the French,
and was esteemed one of the prime posts for trading with the
Indians. The chief tribes who were located here, and in the vicinity,
making this their central point of trade, were the <i>Puants</i>,
i. e. Winnebagoes, Malomonies, or Folle Avoins, known to us
as Menomonies, Sacs, and Foxes, called also Sakis, Outagami,
and Renouards, and it was also the seat of trade for the equivocal
tribe of the Mascoutins. The present inhabitants are, with
few exceptions, descendants of the original French, who intermarried
with Indian women, and who still speak the French and
Indian languages. They are indolent, gay, and illiterate. I was
told there were five hundred inhabitants, and about sixty principal
dwellings, beside temporary structures. There are seventy
inhabitants enrolled as militia-men, and the settlement has civil
courts, being the seat of justice from Brown County, Michigan,
so called in honor of Major-General Jacob Brown, U. S. A. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
place is surrounded by the woodlands and forests, and seems
destined to be an important lake-port.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[125]</a> The Algonquin name
for this place is Boatchweekwaid, a term which describes an eccentric
or abrupt bay, or inlet. Nothing could more truly depict
its singular position; it is, in fact, a kind of cul-de-sac&mdash;a duplicature
of Lake Michigan, with the coast-shore of which it lies
parallel for about ninety miles.</p>

<p>The singular configuration of this bay appears to be the chief
cause of the appearances of a tide at the point where it is entered by
Fox River. This phenomenon was early noticed by the French.
La Hontan mentions it in 1689. Charlevoix remarks on it in
1721, and suggests its probable cause, which is, in his opinion,
explained by the fact that Lakes Michigan and Huron, alternately
empty themselves into each other through the Straits of Michilimackinac.
The effects of such a flux and reflux, under the
power of the winds, would appear to place Green Bay in the position
of a siphon, on the west of Lake Michigan, and go far to
account for the singular fluctuations of the current at the mouth
of the Fox River. On reaching this spot of the rising and falling
of the lake waters, Governor Cass caused observations to be made,
which he greatly extended at a subsequent period.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[126]</a> These give
no countenance to the theory of regular tides, but denote the
changes in the level of the waters to be eccentrically irregular,
and dependent, so far as the observations extend, altogether on
the condition of the winds and currents of the lakes.</p>

<p>Something analogous to this is perceived in the Baltic, which
has no regular tides, and therefore experiences no difference of
height, except when the wind blows violently. "At such times,"
says Pennant,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[127]</a> "there is a current in and out of the Baltic, according
to the points they blow from, which forces the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>through the sound, with the velocity of two or three Danish
miles in the hour. When the wind blows violently from the
German Sea, the water rises in several Baltic harbors, and gives
those in the western tract a temporary saltness; otherwise, the
Baltic loses that other property of a sea, by reason of the want
of tide, and the quantity of vast rivers it receives, which sweeten
it so much as to render it, in many places, fit for domestic use."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">The expedition traces the west shores of Lake Michigan southerly to Chicago&mdash;Outline
of the journey along this coast&mdash;Sites of Manitoowoc, Sheboigan, Milwaukie,
Racine, and Chicago, being the present chief towns and cities of Wisconsin
and Illinois on the west shores of that Lake&mdash;Final reorganization of
the party and departure from Chicago.</p>

<p>Two days spent in preparations to reorganize the expedition,
enabled it to continue its explorations. For the purpose of
tracing the western and northern shores of Green Bay, and the
northern shores of Lake Michigan, a sub-expedition was fitted
out, under Mr. Trowbridge, our sub-topographer, who was accompanied
by Mr. J. D. Doty, Mr. Alex. R. Chase, and James
Riley, the Chippewa interpreter. The auxiliary Indians, who
had, thus far, attended us in a separate canoe, were rewarded for
their services, furnished with provisions to reach their homes,
and dismissed. The escort of soldiers under Lieut. Mackay,
U. S. A., were returned to their respective companies at Fort
Howard and Camp Smith. The Chippewa chief, <i>Iaba Wawashkash</i>,
or the Buck, who belonged to Michilimackinac, went with
Mr. Trowbridge, together with Jo Parks, the intelligent Shawnee
captive, and assimilated Shawnee of Waughpekennota,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[128]</a> Ohio.
The Ottowa chief, Kewaygooshkum, of Grand-River, took the
rest of the party in a separate canoe to their destination. Our
collections in natural history were shipped in the schooner De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>catur,
Capt. Burnham (Perry's boatswain in the memorable naval
battle of Lake Erie, Sept. 11, 1813), to Michilimackinac, together
with the extra baggage.</p>

<p>Thus relieved in numbers and canoe-hamper, we were reduced
to two canoes; the travelling family of Gov. Cass now consisted
of Capt. Douglass, Dr. Wolcott, Maj. Forsyth, Lieut. Mackay, and
myself. Leaving Fort Howard at two o'clock P. M., we parted
with Mr. Trowbridge and his party at the mouth of Fox River,
at half past two, and taking the other, or east side of the bay,
proceeded along its shores about twenty-five miles, and encamped
on the coast called Red Banks. This is a term translated from
the Winnebago name, which is renowned in their traditions as
the earliest spot which they can recollect. They dwelt here when
the French first reached Green Bay in their discoveries in the
seventeenth century. Here, then, is a test of the value and continuity
of Indian tradition, so far as this tribe is concerned, for
admitting, what is doubtful, that the French reached this point
so early as 1650, the period of recognized Winnebago history, as
proved by geography, reaches but 170 years prior to the above
date.</p>

<p>In a short time after entering the bay, we were overtaken by
Kewaygooshkum and his party, who travelled and encamped with
us. In the course of the evening he pointed out a rocky island,
at three or four miles distance, containing a large cavern, which
has been used by the Indians from early times as a repository for
the dead. The chief, as he pointed to it, as if absorbed in a spirit
of ancestral reverence, seemed to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p>"It hath a charm the stranger knoweth not,</p>
<p>It is the [sepulchre] of mine ancestry;</p>
<p>There is an inspiration in its shade,</p>
<p>The echoes of its walls are eloquent,</p>
<p>The words they speak are of the glorious dead;</p>
<p>Its tenants are not human&mdash;they are more!</p>
<p>It is the home of memories dearly honored</p>
<p>By many a trace of long departed glory."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The appearance of ancient cultivation of this coast is such as
to give semblance to the Winnebago tradition of its having been
their former residence. The lands are fertile, alluvion, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a secondary growth of trees, mingled with older species of the acer
saccharinum, elm, and oak.</p>

<p>The next day, after traversing this coast twenty miles further,
we reached and passed up Sturgeon Bay, to a portage path leading
to Lake Michigan. This path begins in low grounds, where
several of the swamp species of plants occur. On reaching the
open shores of Lake Michigan, the wind was found strongly
ahead, and we were compelled to encamp. At this spot we found
several species of madreperes, and some other organic forms,
among the shore debris. The next day the wind abated, and,
agreeably to the estimate of Capt. Douglass, we advanced along
the shore, southwardly, forty-six miles. The day following, we
made forty miles, and reached the River Manitowakie,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[129]</a> and encamped
on the lake shore, five miles south of it.</p>

<p>In passing along the lake shore this day (25th), we observed it
to be strewed abundantly with the carcasses of dead pigeons. This
bird, we were told, is often overcome by the fatigue of long flights,
or storms, in crossing the lake, and entire flocks drowned. This
causes the shores to be visited by great numbers of hawks, eagles,
and other birds of prey. The Indians only make use of those
carcasses of pigeons, as food, when they are first cast on shore.</p>

<p>The next day the expedition passed the mouth of the Sheboigan
River, a stream originating not remotely from the banks of
Winnebago Lake, with which, as the name indicates, there is a
portage or passage through.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[130]</a> Pushing forward with every force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>during the day, we reached the mouth of the Milwaukie River,
and encamped on the beach some time after dark. This is a
large and important river, and is connected by an Indian portage
with the Rock River of the Mississippi. The next morning
adverse winds confined us to this spot, where we remained a considerable
part of the day, which enabled us to explore the locality.
We found it to be the site of a Pottawattomie village. There
were two American families located at that place, engaged in the
Indian trade.</p>

<p>The name of Milwaukie,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[131]</a> exhibits an instance of which there
are many others, in which the French have substituted the sound
of the letter <i>l</i> in place of <i>n</i>, in Indian words. <i>Min</i>, in the Algonquin
languages signifies <i>good</i>. <i>Waukie</i>, is a derivative from <i>auki</i>,
earth or land, the fertility of the soil, along the banks of that
stream, being the characteristic trait which is described in the Indian
compound.</p>

<p>When the wind lulled so as to permit embarkation, we proceeded
on our course. At the computed distance of five miles, we
observed a bed of light-colored tertiary clay, possessing a compactness,
tenacity, and feel, which denote its utility in the arts.
This bed, after a break of many miles in the shores, reappears in
thicker and more massive layers, at eight or ten miles distance.
The waves dashing against this elevated bank of clay,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[132]</a> have
liberated balls and crystallized-masses of sulphuret of iron.</p>

<p>Some of the more recently exposed masses of this mineral are
of a bright brass color. The tendency of their crystallization is
to restore octahedral and cubical forms. We advanced along this
shore about thirty-five miles, encamping on an eligible part of the
beach before dark. I found, in examining the mineralogy of the
coast, masses of detached limestone, containing fissures filled with
asphaltum. On breaking these masses, and laying open the fissures,
the substance assumed the form of naphtha. We observed
among the plants along this portion of coast, the tradescantia vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>ginica,
and T. liatris, and squarrosa scariosa.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[133]</a> By scrutinizing the
wave-moved pebble-drift along shore, it is evident that inferior
positions, in the geological basin of Lake Michigan, contain slaty,
or bituminous coal, masses of which were developed.</p>

<p>The next day's journey, 28th, carried us forty miles, in which
distance, the most noticeable fact in the topography of the coast,
was the entrance of the Racine, or Root River;<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[134]</a> its eligible shores
being occupied by some Pottawattomie lodges. Having reached
within ten or twelve miles of Chicago, and being anxious to make
that point, we were in motion at a very early hour on the morning
of the 29th, and reached the village at five o'clock A. M.
We found four or five families living here, the principal of which
were those of Mr. John Kinzie, Dr. A. Wolcott, J. B. Bobian, and
Mr. J. Crafts, the latter living a short distance up the river. The
Pottawattomies, to whom this site is the capital of their trade, appeared
to be lords of the soil, and truly are entitled to the epithet,
if laziness, and an utter inappreciation of the value of time, be a
test of lordliness. Dr. Wolcott, being the U. S. Agent for this
tribe, found himself at home here, and constitutes no further, a
member of the expedition. Gov. Cass determined to return to
Detroit from this point, on horseback, across the peninsula of
Michigan, accompanied by Lt. Mackay, U. S. A., Maj. Forsyth,
his private secretary, and the necessary number of men and pack
horses to prepare their night encampments. This left Capt.
Douglass and myself to continue the survey of the Lakes, and
after reaching Michilimackinac and rejoining the party of Mr.
Trowbridge, to return to Detroit from that point.</p>

<p>The preparation for these ends occupied a couple of days, which
gave us an opportunity to scan the vicinity. We found the post
(Fort Dearborn) under the command of Capt. Bradley, with a
force of one hundred and sixty men. The river is ample and
deep for a few miles, but is utterly choked up by the lake sands,
through which, behind a masked margin, it oozes its way for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>mile or two, till it percolates through the sands into the lake. Its
banks consist of a black arenaceous fertile soil, which is stated to
produce abundantly, in its season, the wild species of cepa, or leek.
This circumstance has led the natives to name it the place of the
wild leek. Such is the origin of the term Chicago,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[135]</a> which is a
derivative, by elision and French annotation, from the word <i>Chi-kaug-ong</i>.
<i>Kaug</i>, is the Algonquin name for the hystrix, or porcupine.
It takes the prefix <i>Chi</i>, when applied to the mustela
putorius. The particle <i>Chi</i>, is the common prefix of nouns to denote
greatness in any natural object, but it is also employed, as
here, to mean increase, or excess, as acridness, or pungency, in
quality. The penultimate <i>ong</i>, denotes locality. The putorius
is so named from this plant, and not, as has been thought, the
plant from it. I took the sketch, which is reproduced in the
fourth vol. of my <i>Ethnological Researches</i>, Plate xxvii., from a standpoint
on the flat of sand which stretched in front of the place.
This view embraces every house in the village, with the fort; and
if the reproduction of the artist in vol. iv. may be subjected to
any criticism, it is, perhaps, that the stockade bears too great a
proportion to the scene, while the precipice observed in the shore
line of sand, is wholly wanting in the original.</p>

<p>The country around Chicago is the most fertile and beautiful
that can be imagined. It consists of an intermixture of woods
and prairies, diversified with gentle slopes, sometimes attaining
the elevation of hills, and it is irrigated with a number of clear
streams and rivers, which throw their waters partly into Lake
Michigan, and partly into the Mississippi River. As a farming
country, it presents the greatest facilities for raising stock and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>grains, and it is one of the most favored parts of the Mississippi
Valley; the climate has a delightful serenity, and it must, as soon
as the Indian title is extinguished,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[136]</a> become one of the most attractive
fields for the emigrant. To the ordinary advantages of an
agricultural market town, it must add that of being a depot for
the commerce between the northern and southern sections of the
Union, and a great thoroughfare for strangers, merchants, and
travellers.</p>

<p>The Milwaukie clays to which I have adverted, do not extend
thus far, although the argillaceous deposits found, appear to be
destitute of the oxide of iron, for the bricks produced from them
burn white. There is a locality of bituminous coal on Fox River,
about forty miles south. Near, the junction of the Desplaines
River with the Kankakee, there exists in the semi-crystalline or
sedimentary limestone, a remarkable fossil-tree.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[137]</a></p>

<p>It was now the last day of August. Having partaken of the
hospitalities of Mr. Kinzie, and of Captains Bradley and Green, of
Fort Dearborn, during our stay at Chicago, and completed the
reorganization of our parties, we separated on the last day of the
month, at two o'clock P. M.; Gov. Cass and his party, on horseback,
taking the old Indian trail to Detroit, and Capt. Douglass
and myself being left, with two canoes, to complete the circumnavigation
of the lakes. We did not delay our departure over
thirty minutes, but bidding adieu to Dr. Wolcott, whose manners,
judgment, and intelligence had commanded our respect during
the journey, embarked with two canoes; our steersmen immediately
hoisted their square sails, and, favored by a good breeze,
we proceeded twenty miles along the southern curve, at the head
of Lake Michigan, and encamped.</p>

<p>Within two miles of Chicago, we passed, on the open shores
of the lake, the scene of the massacre of Chicago, of the 15th of
August, 1812, being the day after the surrender of Detroit by
Gen. Hull. Gloom hung, at that eventful period, over every
part of our western borders. Michilimackinac had already been
carried by surprise; and the ill-advised order to evacuate Chicago,
was deemed by the Indians an admission that the Americans
were to be driven from the country. The Pottawattomies determined
to show the power of their hostility on this occasion.
Capt. Heald, the commanding officer, having received Gen. Hull's
order to abandon the post, and having an escort of thirty friendly
Miamis, from Fort Wayne, under Captain Wells, had quitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
fort at nine o'clock in the morning, with fifty-four regulars, a
subaltern, physician, twelve militia, and the necessary baggage
wagons for the provisions and ammunition, which contained eighteen
soldiers, women and children. They had not proceeded more
than a mile and a half along the shore of the lake, when an ambuscade
of Indians was discovered behind the sand-hills which
encompass the flat sandy shore. The horrid yell, which rose on
the discovery being made, was accompanied by a general and
deadly fire from them. Several men fell at the first fire, but Capt.
Heald formed his men, and effected a charge up the bank, which
dispersed his assailants. It was only, however, to find the enemy
return by a flank movement, in which their numbers gave them the
victory. In a few moments, out of his effective force of sixty-six
men, but sixteen survived. With these, he succeeded in drawing
off to a position in the prairie, where he was not followed by the
Indians. On a negotiation, opened by a chief called Mukudapenais,
he surrendered, under promise of security for their lives.
This promise was afterwards violated, with the exception of himself
and three or four men. Among the slain was Ensign Ronan,
Dr. Voorhis, and Capt. Wells. The latter had his heart cut out,
and his body received other shocking indignities. The saddest
part of the tragedy was the attack on the women and children
who occupied the baggage wagons, and were all slain. Several
of the women fought with swords. During the action, a sergeant
of infantry ran his bayonet through the heart of an Indian who
had lifted his tomahawk to strike him; not being able to withdraw
the instrument, it served to hold up the Indian, who actually
tomahawked him in this position, and both fell dead together.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[138]</a>
The Miamis remained neuter in this massacre. Mr.
Kinzie, of Chicago, of whose hospitalities we had partaken, was a
witness of this transaction, and furnished the principal facts of
this narrative.</p>

<p>The morning (Sept. 1) opened with a perfect gale, and we were
<i>degradè</i>, to use a Canadian term, all day; the waves dashed against
the shore with a violence that made it impossible to take the lake
with canoes, and would have rendered it perilous even to a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>vessel. This violence continued, with no perceptible diminution,
during the day. As a mode of relief from the tedium of delay,
a short excursion was made into the prairie. I found a few species
of the unio, in a partially choked up branch of the Konamek.
Capt. Douglass improved the time by taking observations for the
latitude, and we footed around ten miles of the extreme southern
head of the lake. It is edged with sand-hills, bearing pines. A
few dead valves of the fresh-water muscle were found on the shore.</p>

<p>On the following day the wind lulled, when we proceeded fifty-four
miles, passing in the distance the remains of the schooner
Hercules, which went ashore in a gale, in November, 1816, and
all on board perished; her mast, pump, spars, and the graves of
the passengers, among which, was that of Lieut. W. S. Eveleth,
U. S. A., were pointed out to us. We landed a few moments at
the entrance of the River du Chemin,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[139]</a> where the trail to Detroit
leaves the lake shore. The distance to that city is estimated at
three hundred miles. Ten miles beyond this spot we passed the
little River Galien, where, at this time, the town and harbor of
New Buffalo, of Michigan, is situated, and we encamped on the
shore twelve miles beyond it.</p>

<p>We had been travelling on a slightly curved line from Chicago
to the spot, in the latitude of 41° 52´ 20´´, and had now reached
a point where the course tends more directly to the northeast and
north. By the best accounts, the length of Lake Michigan, lying
directly from south to north, is four hundred miles. There is no
other lake in America, north or south, which traverses so many
degrees of latitude, and we had reason to expect its flora and
fauna to denote some striking changes. We had passed down
its west, or Wisconsin shore, from Sturgeon Bay, finding it to
present a clear margin of forest, with many good harbors, and a
fertile, gently undulating surface. But we were now to encounter
another cast of scenery. It is manifest, from a survey of the
eastern shore of this lake, that the prevalent winds are from the
west and northwest, for they have cast up vast sand dunes along
the coast, which give it an arid appearance. These dunes are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>however, but a hem on the fertile prairie lands, not extending
more than half a mile or more, and thus masking the fertile lands.
Water, in the shape of lagoons, is often accumulated behind these
sand-banks, and the force of the winds is such as to choke and
sometimes entirely shut up the mouth of its rivers. We had
found this hem of sand-hills extending around the southern
shore of the lake from the vicinity of Chicago, and soon found
that it gave an appearance of sterility to the country that it by no
means merited. On reaching the mouth of St. Joseph's River (3d),
a full exemplification of this striking effect of the lake action was
exhibited. This is one of the largest rivers of the peninsula, running
for more than a hundred and twenty miles through a succession
of rich plains and prairies; yet its mouth, which carries a large
volume of water into the lake, is rendered difficult of entrance to
vessels, and its lake-borders are loaded with drifts of shifting sand.</p>

<p>The next day's journey carried us fifty miles; and, on proceeding
ten miles further on the 4th, we reached the mouth of the
Kalamazoo.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[140]</a> Before reaching this river, I discovered on the
beach a body of detached orbicular masses of the calcareous marl
called septaria&mdash;the ludus helmontii of the old mineralogists. On
breaking some of these masses, they disclosed small crystalline
seams of sulphuret of zinc. The Kalamazoo irrigates a fine tract
of the most fertile and beautiful prairies of Michigan, which, at the
date of the revision of this journal, is studded with flourishing
towns and villages.</p>

<p>Fifteen miles further progress towards the north, brought us to
the mouth of Grand River&mdash;the Washtenong of the Indians&mdash;which
is, I believe the largest and longest stream of the Michigan
peninsula. It is the boundary between the hunting-grounds of
the Pottowattomies (who have thus far claimed jurisdiction from
Chicago) and the Ottowas. The latter live in large numbers at
its rapids and on its various tributaries.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[141]</a> The next stream of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>note we encountered was the Maskigon, twelve miles north of
Grand River, where we encamped, having travelled, during the
day, fifty-four miles. The view of this scene was impressive from
its bleakness, the dunes of sand being more at the mercy of the
winds. I found here a large, branching specimen of the club-fungus,
attached to a dead specimen of the populus tremuloides,
which had been completely penetrated by these drifting sands, so
as to present quite the appearance, and no little part of the hardness
and consistency, of a fossil. The following figure of this
transformation from a fungus to a semi-stony body, presents a
perfect outline of it as sketched in its original position.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-204.jpg" width="500" height="478" alt="" /></div>

<p>On the day of our departure from the Maskigon, we enjoyed
fine weather and favorable winds, and proceeded, from the data
of Captain Douglass, seventy miles, and encamped a few miles
beyond the Sandy River. In this line of coast, we passed, successively,
the White, Pentwater, and Marquette. Of these, the latter,
both from its size and its historical associations, is by far the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>important; for it was at this spot, after having spent years of
devotion in the cause of missions in New France&mdash;in the course
of which he discovered the Mississippi River&mdash;that this zealous
servant of God laid down in his tent, after a hard day's travel,
and surrendered up his life. The event occurred on the 8th of
May, 1675, but two years after his grand discovery. Marquette
was a native of Laon, in Picardy, where his family was of distinguished
rank. The precise moment of his death was not witnessed,
his men having retired to leave him to his devotions, but
returning, in a short time, found him lifeless. They carried his
body to the mission of old Michilimackinac, of which he was the
founder, where it was interred.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[142]</a></p>

<p>It rained the next morning (6th), by which we lost two hours,
and we had some unfavorable winds, but, by dint of hard pushing,
we made forty-five miles, and slept at Gravelly Point. In this line
we passed successively, at distances of seventeen and thirty miles,
the rivers Manistic and <i>Becsie</i>, which is the Canadian phrase for
the anas canadensis. Clouds and murky weather still hovered
around us on the next morning, but we left our encampment at
an early hour. Thirteen miles brought us to the Omicomico, or
Plate River, nine miles beyond which found us in front of a remarkable
and very elevated sand June, called the Sleeping Bear&mdash;a
fanciful term, derived from the Indian, through the French
<i>l'ours qui dormis</i>. Opposite this feature in the coast geology, lie
the two large wooded islands called the Minitos&mdash;well-known
objects to all mariners who venture into the vast unsheltered
basin of the southern body of Lake Michigan. Thirty miles beyond
this sandy elevation, brought us to the southern cape of Grand Traverse
Bay, where we encamped, having advanced fifty-two miles.
This was the first place where we had noticed rocks in situ,
since passing the little Konamic River, near Chicago. It proved
to be limestone, of the same apparent era of the calcareous rock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>which we had observed at Sturgeon Bay and the contiguous west
shore of Lake Michigan. The line of lake coast included in this
remark is three hundred and twenty miles; during all which distance
the coast seems, but only seems, to be the sport of the fierce
gales and storms, for there is reason to believe that the formations
of drift clay, sand, and gravel rest, at various depths, on a
stratification of solid, permanent rock. To us, however, it proved
a barren field for the collection of both geological and mineralogical
specimens. There were gleaned some rolled specimens of
organic remains, of no further use than to denote the occurrence
of these in some part of a vast basin. There was a specimen of
gypsum from Grand River. The few patches of iron sand I had
noticed, were hardly worthy of record after the heavy beds of
this mineral which we had passed in Lake Superior. The same
remark may be made of the few rolled fragments of calcedonies,
and other varieties of the quartz family, gleaned up along its
shores, for neither of these constitute a reliable locality.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-206.jpg" width="300" height="343" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Petrified leaf of the <i>Fagus Ferruginea</i></p>


<p>Of the floræ and fauna we had been observant, but the sandy
character of the mere coast line greatly narrowed the former, in
which Captain Douglass found but little to preserve, beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
parnassia caroliniana and seottia cerna.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[143]</a> The fury of the waves
renders it a region wholly unfitted to the whole tribe of fresh-water
shells. A petrifaction of the fagus ferruginia, brought from
a spring on the banks of the St. Joseph's River by Gov. Cass, on
his home route, on horseback, presented the petrifying process in
one of its most perfect forms (<i>vide</i> p. 206). Surfeited with a species
of scenery in which the naked sand dunes were often painful to
the eye, from their ophthalmic influence, and of geological prostrations
which seemed to lay the coast in ruins, we were glad
to reach the solid rock formations, supporting, as they did, a soil
favorable to green forests.</p>

<p>A partial eclipse of the sun had been calculated for the 5th of
September (1820), to commence at seven o'clock, twenty minutes;
but, though we were on the lake, and anxious to note it, the
weather proved to be too much overcast, and no effects of it were
observed. This eclipse was observed, according to the predictions,
at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The morning of the 8th proved calm, which permitted us to
cross the mouth of Grand Traverse Bay. This piece of water is
nine miles across, with an unexplored depth, and has some 300
Chippewas living on its borders. Six miles north of this point,
we reached and crossed Little Traverse Bay, which is occupied
by Ottawas. These two tribes are close confederates, speak dialects
of the same language which is readily understood by both,
and live on the most friendly terms. The Ottowas on the head
of Little Traverse Bay, and on the adjoining coast of Lake Michigan&mdash;which,
from its principal village, bears the names of Village
of the Cross, and of Waganukizzie,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[144]</a> or L'Arbre Croche&mdash;are, to a
great extent, cultivators of the soil, and have adopted the use of
hats, and the French <i>capot</i>, having laid aside paints and feathers.
They raise large quantities of Indian corn for the Mackinac market,
and manufacture, in the season, from the sap of the acer saccharinum,
considerable quantities of maple sugar, which is put
up, in somewhat elongated bark boxes, called muckucks, in which
it is carried to the same market. We found them, wherever they
were encountered, a people of friendly manners and comity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>We were now drawing toward the foot of Lake Michigan, at
the point where this inland sea is connected, through the Straits
of Michilimackinac, with Lake Huron. A cluster of islands,
called the Beaver Islands, had been in sight on our left hand,
since passing the coast of the Sleeping Bear, which are noted
as affording good anchorage ground to vessels navigating the
lake. It is twenty-five miles from the site of the old French mission,
near L'Arbre Croche, to the end of point Wagoshance,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[145]</a>
which is the southeast cape of the Straits of Michilimackinac,
and nine miles from thence to the Island. Along the bleak coast
of this storm-beaten, horizontal limestone rock, with a thin covering
of drift, we diligently passed. Night overtook us as we came
through the straits, hugging their eastern shore, and we encamped
on a little circular open bay, long after it became pitchy dark.
We had traversed a coast line of fifty-seven miles, and were glad,
after a refreshing cup of tea and our usual meal, to retire to our
pallets.</p>

<p>The next morning revealed our position. We were at the
ancient site of old Michilimackinac&mdash;a spot celebrated in the early
missionary annals and history of New France. This was, indeed,
one of the first points settled by the French after Cadaracqui,
being a missionary and trading station before the foundation of
Fort Niagara, in 1678; for La Salle, after determining on the latter,
proceeded, the same fall, up the lakes to this point, which he
installed with a military element. The mission of St. Ignace
had before been attempted on the north shore of the straits, but
it was finally removed here by the advice of Marquette. On
gazing at the straits, they were found to be agitated by a perfect
gale. This gave time for examining the vicinity. It was found
a deserted plain, overspread with sand, in many parts, with the
ruins of former occupancy piercing through these sandy drifts,
which gave it an air of perfect desolation. By far the most conspicuous
among these ruins, was the stone foundation of the
ancient fort, and the excavations of the exterior buildings, which
had evidently composed a part of the military or missionary plan.
Not a house, not a cultivated field, not a fence was to be seen.
The remains of broken pottery, and pieces of black bottles, irri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>descent
from age, served impressively to show that men had once
eaten and drank here. It was in 1763, in the outbreak of the
Pontiac war, that this fort, then recently surrendered to the English,
was captured, by a <i>coup-de-main</i>, by the Indians. The English,
probably doubting its safety, during the American Revolution,
removed the garrison to the island, which had, indeed, furnished
the name of Michilimackinac before; for the Indians had, <i>ab initio</i>,
called the old post Peekwutinong, or Headland-place, applying
the other name exclusively, as at this day, to the Gibraltar-like
island which rises up, with its picturesque cliffs, from the very
depths of Lake Huron. The sketch of this scene of desolation,
with the Island in view, is given in the second volume of my
<i>Ethnological Researches</i>, Plate LIII.</p>

<p>After pacing the plain of this ancient point of French settlement
in every point, we returned to our tent about eleven o'clock
A. M., and deemed it practicable to attempt the crossing to the island
in a light canoe, for, although the gale was little if any abated,
the wind blew fair. I concurred in the opinion of Captain Douglass
that this might be done, and very readily assented to try it,
leaving the men in the baggage canoe to effect the passage when
the wind fell. It cannot be asserted that this passage was without
hazard; for my own part, I had too much trust in my nature
to fear it, and, if we were ever wafted on "the wings of the wind,"
it was on this occasion; our boatmen, volunteers for the occasion,
reefing the sails to two feet, and we owed our success mainly to
their good management. On rounding the Ottowa point, which
is the south cape of the little harbor of 'Mackinac, our friends
who had parted from us at Green Bay were among the first to
greet us. By the union of these two parties, the circumnavigation
of Lake Michigan had been completely made. The rate of
travel along the line traversed by them was computed at forty-five
miles per day. They had been eight days on the route. The
coast line traversed by Captain Douglass and myself, since quitting
Chicago, is four hundred and thirty-nine miles, giving a mean of
forty-three miles per diem, of which one entire day was lost by
head winds.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Topographical survey of the northern shores of Green Bay and of the entire basin of
Lake Michigan&mdash;Geological and Mineralogical indicia of the coast line&mdash;Era of
sailing vessels and of the steamboat on the lakes&mdash;Route along the Huron coast,
and return of the expedition to Detroit.</p>

<p>The coast line traversed by the party detached from Green
Bay on the 22d of August, under Mr. Trowbridge, extended from
the north shore of Fox River to the entrance of the Monominee
River, and thence around the Little and Great Bay de Nocquet,
to the northwestern cape of the entrance of Green Bay. From
the latter point, the northern shore of Lake Michigan was traced
by the Manistic, and the other smaller rivers of that coast, to the
northern cape of the Straits of Michilimackinac, and through
these to Point St. Ignace and the Island of Michilimackinac. The
line of survey, agreeably to their reckoning, embraced two hundred
and eighty miles, thus closing the topographical survey of
the entire coast line of the basin of Lake Michigan, and placing
in the hands of Captain Douglass the notes and materials for a
perfect map of the lake.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[146]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Trowbridge, whom I had requested to note the features of
its geology and mineralogy, presented me with labelled specimens
of the succession of strata which he had collected on the route.
These denoted the continuance of the calcareous, horizontal series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>of formations of the Fox Valley, and of the islands of Green Bay,
quite around those northern waters to the closing up of the surveys
at Point St. Ignace and Michilimackinac. Nor do the primitive
rocks disclose themselves on any part of that line of coast.
Of this collection, Mr. Trowbridge well observes, in his report to
me, the most interesting will probably be the organic remains.
These were procured on the northeast side of Little Nocquet Bay,
where areas of limestone appear. They consist of duplicates of
the pectinite. Three layers of this, the magnesian limestone, show
themselves at this place, of which the intermediate bed is of a
dull blue color and compact structure, and is composed in a great
measure of the remains of this species. It is comparatively soft
when first taken up, but hardens by exposure. About ten miles
north of this point, the upper calcareous, or surface rock, embraces
nodules of hornstone. Specimens of a semi-crystalline
limestone, labelled "marble," were also brought from a cliff, composed
of this rock, on the lake shore, about thirty to forty miles
southwest from Michilimackinac. Mr. Doty also brought some
specimens of sulphate of lime, cal. spar, and some of the common
rolled members of the quartz-drift stratum.</p>

<p>Michilimackinac is a name associated with our earliest ideas of
history in the upper lakes. How so formidable a polysyllabic
term came to be adopted by usage, it may be difficult to tell, till
we are informed that the inhabitants, in speaking the word, clip
off the first three syllables, leaving the last three to carry the
whole meaning. The full term is, however, perpetuated by legal
enactment, this part of Michigan having been organized into a
separate county some time, I believe, during the administration of
Gen. Hull. The military gentlemen call the fort on the cliff,
"Mackin[=a]," the townspeople pronounce it Mackinaw; but if a
man be hauled up on a magistrate's writ, it is in name of the
sovereignty of Michilimackinac. Thus law and etymology grow
strong together.</p>

<p>Commerce, we observe, is beginning to show itself here, but
by the few vessels we have met, while traversing these broad and
stormy seas, and their little tonnage, it seems as if they were
stealthily making their way into regions of doubtful profit at
least. The fur trade employs most of these, either in bringing up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>supplies, or carrying away its avails. La Salle, when, in 1679,
he built the first vessel on the lakes, and sent it up to traffic in
furs, was greatly in advance of his age; but he could hardly have
anticipated that his countrymen should have adhered so long to
the tedious and dangerous mode of making these long voyages in
the bark canoe. It is memorable in the history of the region,
that last year (1819) witnessed the first arrival of a steamer at
Michilimackinac. It bore the characteristic name of Walk-in-the-water,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[147]</a>
the name of a Wyandot chief of some local celebrity
in Detroit, during the last war.</p>

<p>The astonishment produced upon the Indian mind by the arrival
of this steamer has been described to us as very great; but,
from a fuller acquaintance with the Indian character, we do not
think him prone to this emotion. He gazes on new objects with
imperturbability, and soon explains what he does not understand
by what he does. Perceiving heat to be the primary cause of the
motion, without knowing how that motion is generated, he calls
the steamboat Ishcoda Nabequon, <i>i. e.</i> fire-vessel, and remains profoundly
ignorant of the motive power of steam. The story of the
vessel's being drawn by great fishes from the sea, is simply one of
those fictions which white loungers about the Indian posts fabricate
to supply the wants of travellers in search of the picturesque.</p>

<p>The winds seem to be unloosed from their mythologic bags,
on the upper lakes, with the autumnal equinox; and we found
them ready for their labors early in September; but it was not
till the 13th of that month, after a detention of two days, that we
found it practicable for canoes to leave the island. Mustering
now a flotilla of three canoes, we embarked at three o'clock P.M.,
with a wind from the east, being moderately adverse, but soon
got under the shelter of the island of Boisblanc; we passed along
its inner shore about ten miles, till reaching Point aux Pins&mdash;so
named from the prevalence here of the pinus resinosa. At this
point, the wind, stretching openly through this passage from the
east, compelled us to land and encamp. The next day, we were
confined to the spot by adverse winds. While thus detained,
Captain Douglass, under shelter of the island, returned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>Mackinac, in a light canoe, doubly manned, for something he had
left. When he returned, the wind had so far abated that we embarked,
and crossed the separating channel, of about four miles,
to the peninsula, and encamped near the River Cheboigan.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[148]</a> This
was a tedious beginning of our voyage to Detroit; the first day
had carried us only <i>ten</i> miles, the second but <i>four</i>.</p>

<p>We were now to retraverse the shores of the Huron, along
which we had encountered such delays in our outward passage,
and the men applied themselves to the task with that impulse
which all partake of when returning from a long journey. Winds
we could not control, but every moment of calm was improved.
Paddle and song were plied by them late and early. A violent
rain-storm happened during the night, but it ceased at daybreak,
when we embarked and traversed a coast line of forty-four miles,
encamping at Presque Isle. Rain fell copiously during the night,
and the unsettled and changing state of the atmosphere kept us
in perpetual agitation during the day. Notwithstanding these
changes, we embarked at five o'clock in the morning (16th), and,
by dint of perseverance, made thirty miles. We slept on the
west cape of Thunder Bay. Next morning, we landed a few
moments on the Idol Island, in Thunder Bay, and, continuing
along the sandy shore of the <i>au sauble</i>, or Iosco coast, entered
Saganaw Bay, and encamped, on its west shore, at Sandy Point.
Indians of the Chippewa language were encountered at this spot,
whose manners and habits appeared to be quite modified by long
contact with the white race.</p>

<p>The morning of the 18th (Sept.) proved fair, which enabled us
to cross the bay, taking the island of Shawangunk in our course,
where we stopped an hour, and re-examined its calcedonies and
other minerals. We then proceeded across to Oak Point, on its
eastern shore, and, coasting down to, and around, the precipitous
cliffs of Point aux Barques, encamped in one of its deeply-indented
coves, having made, during the day, forty-two miles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>The formation of this noted promontory consists of an ash-colored,
not very closely-compacted sandstone, through original
crevices in which the waves have scooped out entrances like vast
corridors. In one of these, which has a sandy beach at its terminus,
we encamped. He who has travelled along the shores of
the lakes, and encamped on their borders, having his ears, while
on his couch, close to the formation of sand, is early and very
exactly apprised of the varying state of the wind. The deep-sounding
roar of the waves, like the deep diapason of a hundred
organs, plays over a gamut, whose rising or falling scale tells him,
immediately, whether he can put his frail canoe before the wind,
or must remain prisoner on the sand, in the sheltering nook
where night overtakes him. These notes, sounded between two
long lines of cavernous rocks, told us, long before daybreak, of
a strong head wind that fixed us to the spot for the day. I
amused myself by gathering some small species of the unio and
the anadonta. Captain Douglass busied himself with astronomical
observations. We all sallied out, during the day, over the
sandy ridges of modern drift, in which the pinus resinosa had
firmly imbedded its roots, and into sphagnous depressions beyond,
where we had, in the June previous, found the sarracenia purpurea,
which is the cococo mukazin, or oral's moccasin of the Indians.
Here we found, as at more westerly points on the lake, the humble
juniperus prostrata, and, in more favorable spots, the ribes
lacustre.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[149]</a></p>

<p>It was stated to us at Michilimackinac, that Lake Huron had
fallen one foot during the last year. It was also added that the
decrease in the lake waters had been noticed for many years, and
that there were, in fact, periodical depressions and refluxes at
periods of seven and fourteen years. A little reflection will,
however, render it manifest that, in a region of country so extensive
and thinly populated, observations must be vaguely made,
and that many circumstances may operate to produce deception
with respect to the permanent diminution or rise of water, as the
prevalence of winds, the quantity of rain and snow which influences
these basins, and the periodical distribution of solar heat.
It has already been remarked, while at the mouth of Fox River,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>that a fluctuation, resembling a tide, has been improperly thought
to exist there, and, indeed, similar phenomena appear to influence
the Baltic. Philosophers have not been wanting, who
have attributed similar appearances to the ocean itself. "It has
been asserted," observed Cuvier, "that the sea is subject to a
continual diminution of its level, and proofs of this are said to
have been observed in some parts of the shores of the Baltic.
Whatever may have been the cause of these appearances, we certainly
know that nothing of the kind has been observed upon our
coast, and, consequently, that there has been no general lowering
of the waters of the ocean. The most ancient seaports still have
their quays and other erections, at the same height above the
level of the sea, as at their first construction. Certain general
movements have been supposed in the sea, from east to west, or
in other directions; but nowhere has any person been able to
ascertain their effects with the least degree of precision."<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[150]</a></p>

<p>On the next day (20th) the wind abated, so as to permit us, at
six o'clock A.M., to issue from our place of detention; but we
soon found the equilibrium of the atmosphere had been too much
disturbed to rely on it. At seven o'clock, and again at nine
o'clock, we were driven ashore; but as soon as it slackened we
were again upon the lake; it finally settled to a light head wind,
against which we urged our way diligently, until eight o'clock
in the evening. The point where we encamped was upon that
long line of deposit of the erratic block, or boulder stratum, of
which the White Rock is one of the largest known pieces. At
four o'clock the next morning, we were again in motion, dancing
up and down on the blue waves; but after proceeding six miles
the wind drove us from the lake, and we again encamped on the
boulder stratum, where we passed the entire day. Nothing is
more characteristic of the upper lake geology, than the frequency
and abundance of these boulders. The causes which have removed
them, at old periods, from their parent bed, were doubtless
oceanic; for the area embraced is too extensive to admit of merely
local action; but we know of no concentration of oceanic currents,
of sufficient force, to bear up these heavy masses, over such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>extensive surfaces, without the supporting media of ice-floes.
The boulders and pebbles are often driven as the moraines before
glacial bodies, and there are not wanting portions of rock
surface, in the west, which are deeply grooved or scratched by
the pressing boulders. The crystallized peaks of the Little Rocks,
above St. Anthony's Falls, have been completely polished by
them.&mdash;<i>Vide</i> p. <a href="#Page_149">149</a>.</p>

<p>The next morning (22d) we were released from our position on
this bleak drift-coast, although the wind was still moderately ahead,
and after toiling twelve hours adown the closing shores of the
lake, we reached its foot, and entered the River St. Clair. Halting
a few moments at Fort Gratiot, we found it under the command
of Lieut. James Watson Webb, who was, however, absent
at the moment. Two miles below, at the mouth of Black River,
we met this officer, who had just returned from an excursion up
the Black River, where he had laid in a supply of fine watermelons,
with which he liberally supplied us. From this spot, we
descended the river seven miles, to Elk Island, on which we encamped
at twilight, having made fifty-seven miles during the day.
Glad to find ourselves out of the reach of the lake winds, and of
Eolus, and all his hosts, against which we may be said to have
fought our way from Michilimackinac, and animated with the prospect
of soon terminating our voyage, we surrounded our evening
board with unwonted spirits and glee. Supper being dispatched,
with many a joke, and terminated with a song in full chorus, and
the men having carefully repaired our canoes, it was determined
to employ the night in descending the placid river, and at nine
o'clock P.M. all was ready and we again embarked. Never did
men more fully appreciate the melody of the Irish bard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Sweetly as tolls the evening chime,</p>
<p>Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time."</p>
</div></div>

<p>At half past three the next morning, we found ourselves at the
entrance to Lake St. Clair, thirty miles from our evening repast.
Owing to the dense fog and darkness, it was now necessary to await
daylight, before attempting to cross. Daylight, which had been
impatiently waited for, brought with it our old lake enemy, head
winds, which made the most experienced men deem the passage
impracticable. Counselled, however, rather by impatience than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
anything else, it was resolved on. Rain soon commenced, which
appeared the signal for increased turbulence; but by dint of hard
pushing in the men, with some help from our own hands, we
succeeded in weathering Point Huron, the first point of shelter.
The right hand shore then became a continued covert, and we
successively saw point after point lessen in the distance. It was
noon when we reached Grosse Point, the original place of our
general embarkation on commencing the expedition; the rest of
the voyage ran like a dream "when one awaketh," and we landed
at the City of Detroit at half past three o'clock P. M.</p>

<p>Gov. Cass, and his equestrian party from Chicago, had preceded
us thirteen days, as will be perceived from the following article
from the weekly press of that city, of September 15, 1820,
which embraces a comprehensive notice of the expedition; its
route, the objects it accomplished, and the effects it may be expected
to have on the leading interests and interior policy of the
country, as well as the drawing forth of its resources.</p>

<p class="section">EXPLORING EXPEDITION.<br />
<span class="small">FROM THE DETROIT GAZETTE.</span></p>

<p>Last Friday evening, Governor Cass arrived here from Chicago,
accompanied by Lieutenant M'Kay and Mr. R. A. Forsyth,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[151]</a> both
of whom belonged to the expedition&mdash;all in good health.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>We understand that the objects of the expedition have been
successfully accomplished. The party has traversed 4,000 miles
of this frontier since the last of May. Their route was from this
place to Michilimackinac, and to the Sault of St. Mary's, where a
treaty was concluded with the Chippewas for the cession of a
tract of land, with a view to the establishment of a military post.
They thence coasted the southern shore of Lake Superior to the
Fond du Lac; ascended the St. Louis River to one of its sources,
and descended a small tributary stream of Sandy Lake to the
Mississippi. They then ascended this latter river to the Upper
Red Cedar Lake, which may be considered as the principal source
of the Mississippi, and which is the reservoir where the small
streams forming that river unite. From this lake they descended
between thirteen and fourteen hundred miles to Prairie du Chien,
passing by the post of St. Peter's on the route. They then navigated
the Ouisconsin to the portage, entered the Fox River, and
descended it to Green Bay. Then the party separated, in order
to obtain a topographical sketch of Lake Michigan. Some of
them coasted the northern shore to Michilimackinac, and the
others took the route by Chicago. From this point they will traverse
the eastern shore of the lake to Michilimackinac, and may
be expected here in the course of a week. Governor Cass returned
from Chicago by land. A correct topographical delineation
of this extensive frontier may now be expected from the
accurate observations of Captain Douglass, who is fully competent
to perform the task. We have heretofore remained in ignorance
upon this subject, and very little has been added to the stock of
geographical knowledge since the French possessed the country.
We understand that all the existing maps are found to be very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>erroneous. The character, numbers, situation, and feelings of the
Indians in those remote regions have been fully explored, and we
trust that much valuable information upon these subjects will be
communicated to the Government and to the public. We learn
that the Indians are peaceable, but that the effect of the immense
distribution of presents to them by the British authorities, at
Malden and at Drummond's Island, has been evident upon their
wishes and feelings through the whole route. Upon the establishment
of our posts, and the judicious distribution of our small
military force, must we rely, and not upon the disposition of the
Indians. The important points of the country are now almost
all occupied by our troops, and these points have been selected
with great judgment. It is thought by the party, that the erection
of a military work at the Saut is essential to our security in
that quarter. It is the key of Lake Superior, and the Indians in
its vicinity are more disaffected than any others upon the route.
Their daily intercourse with Drummond's Island, leaves us no
reason to doubt what are the means by which their feelings are
excited and continued. The importance of this site, in a military
point of view, has not escaped the observation of Mr. Calhoun,
and it was for this purpose that a treaty was directed to be held.
The report which he made to the House of Representatives, in
January last, contains his views upon the subject.</p>

<p>We cannot but hope that no reduction will be made in the
ranks of the army. It is by physical force alone, and by a proper
display of it, that we must expect to keep within reasonable
bounds, the ardent, restless, and discontented savages, by whom
this whole country is filled and surrounded. Few persons living
at a distance are aware of the means which are used, and too successfully
used, by the British agents, to imbitter the minds of the
Indians, and preserve such an influence over them as will insure
their co-operation in the event of any future difficulties. A post
at the Fond du Lac will, before long, be necessary, and it is now
proper that one should be established at the portage between the
Fox and Ouisconsin Rivers.</p>

<p>Mr. Schoolcraft has examined the geological structure of the
country, and has explored, as far as practicable, its mineralogical
treasures. We are happy to learn that this department could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>have been confided to one more able or zealous to effect the objects
connected with it. Extensive collections, illustrating the
natural history of the country, have been made, and will add to
the common stock of American science.</p>

<p>We understand that copper, iron, and lead are very abundant
through the whole country, and that the great mass of copper
upon the Outanagon River has been fully examined. Upon this,
as well as upon other subjects, we hope we shall, in a few days,
be able to communicate more detailed information.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">The search for the veritable source of the Mississippi is resumed.&mdash;Ascent to Cass
Lake, the prior point of discovery&mdash;Pursue the river westerly, through the Andrúsian
Lakes and up the Metoswa Rapids, forty-five miles&mdash;Queen Anne's Lake.</p>

<p>Twelve years elapse between the closing of the prior, and the
opening of the present narrative. In the month of August, 1830,
instructions were received by Mr. Schoolcraft to proceed into the
Upper Mississippi valley, to endeavor to terminate the renewed
hostilities existing between the Chippewa and Sioux tribes.
These directions did not come to hand at the remote post of
Sault de Ste. Marie, at the outlet of Lake Superior, in season to
permit the object to be executed that year. On reporting the
fact that the tribes would be dispersed to their hunting-grounds
before the scene could be reached, and that severe weather would
close the streams with ice before the expedition could possibly
return, the plan was deferred till the next year. Renewed instructions
were issued in the month of April, 1831, and an expedition
organized at St. Mary's to carry them into immediate effect.</p>

<p>These instructions did not require the broad table-lands on
which the river originates to be visited, though the journey
connected itself with preliminary questions; nor was it found
practicable to extend the geographical examinations, in the
Mississippi Valley, beyond about latitude 44°.</p>

<p>The force designed for this expedition consisted of twenty-seven
men, including a botanist and geologist, and a small military
party under Lieut. Robert E. Clary, U. S. A. Entering
Lake Superior, in the month of June, with a bright pure atmosphere
and serene weather, the party enjoyed a succession of
those clear transporting vistas of rock and water scenery, which
render this picturesque basin by far the most magnificent, varied,
and affluent in its prospect in America. It is in this basin only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of all the series of North American lakes which stretch west
from the St. Lawrence, that peaks and high mural walls of volcanic
formation, pierce through, or lift up, the horizontal series
of the silurian system; and that, in the lake region, the latter is
found in singular juxtaposition, by means of these upheavals,
with the senites, sienitic granites, and metamorphic rocks composing
the globe's nucleus, or primary out-pushed stony coats
of these latitudes.</p>

<p>I had passed through this varied and wonder-creating scene
of coast views and long-stretching vistas in 1820, when geology, in
America, at least, was in its infancy, as a member of the organic
government expedition into this quarter of the Union, as detailed
in the preceding pages. I had, in 1826, revisited the whole coast
from Point Iroquois to Fond du Lac, in the exercise of official
duties, connected with the Indian tribes; besides making sectional
expeditions into the regions of the Gargontwa and Mishepecotin,
and of the Takwymenon sand-rock, interior, and coast
lines. But the beauty of the prospects presented in 1831, the
serenity of the weather, and the opportunity which it gave of
revisiting scenes which had before flitted by, as the fragments of
a gorgeous dream, gave to this visit a charm which no length of
time can obliterate. And these attractions were enhanced by
association with the agreeable men who accompanied me; of
whom it may be said that they represented the place of strings
in a melodious harp, whose concurrence was at all times necessary
to produce harmony. The sainted and scene-loving Woolsey<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[152]</a>&mdash;the
self-poised and amiable Houghton, just broke loose
from the initial struggles of life to luxuriate on the geological
smiles of the face of nature in this scene&mdash;ah! where are they?
Death has laid his cold hand on them, to open their eyes on
other, and to us inscrutable scenes.</p>

<p>Passing through this lake, the expedition met the brigade of
boats of the late Mr. Wm. Aitken, from the Upper Mississippi
waters, with the annual returns of furs from that region. He
represented the urgent necessity of an official visit to that section
of the country, where the Indians were in turmoil; but stated, at
the same time, that the waters were too low in the streams at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>sources of the Mississippi to render explorations practicable.
He also represented it impracticable, this season, to enter the
Mississippi by the way of the <i>Broulé</i>, or Misakoda River. This
information was confirmed on reaching Chegoimegon, at the
remarkable group of the Confederation Islands (<i>ante</i>, p. 105).
Returning eight miles on my track, I entered the Muskigo, or
Mauvais River, and ascended this stream by all its bad rafts,
rapids, and portages, to the upper waters of the River St. Croix
of the Mississippi. Crossing the intermediate table-lands, with
their intricate system of lakes and portages to <i>Lac Courteroille</i>,
or Ottawa Lake, I entered one of the main sources of Chippewa
River, and descended this prime tributary stream to its entrance
into the Mississippi, at the foot of Lake Pepin. From the latter
point I descended to Prairie du Chien, and to Galena in Illinois.
Dispatching the men and canoes from this place back to ascend
the Wisconsin River, and meet me at the portage of Fort Winnebago,
I crossed the lead-mine country by land, by the way of the
Pekatolica, Blue Mound, and Four Lakes, to the source of the
Fox River, and rejoining my canoes here, descended this stream
to Green Bay, and returned to my starting-point by the way of
Michilimackinac and the Straits of St. Mary. Two months and
twelve days were employed on the journey, during which a line
of forests and Indian trails had been passed, of two thousand
three hundred miles.</p>

<p>The Indians had been met, and counselled with at various
points, at which presents and provisions were distributed, and
the peace policy of the Government enforced. A Chippewa war
party, under Ninaba, had been arrested on its march against the
Sioux in descending the Red Cedar fork of the Chippewa River.
Information was obtained that nine tribes or bands had united in
their sympathies for the restless Sauks and Foxes, who broke out
in hostility to the United States the following spring. Messages,
with pipes and belts, and in one case notice, with a tomahawk
smeared with vermilion, to symbolize war, had passed between
these tribes.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[153]</a></p>

<p>The information was communicated to the Government, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>suggestion that an expedition should be organized for visiting
remoter regions the next year, and forwarding, at the same time,
detailed estimates of the expenditures essential to its efficiency.
These suggestions were approved by the Secretary of War on
the 3d of May, 1832, and instructions forwarded to me for organizing
an expedition to carry the reconnoissance and scrutiny to
the tribes on the sources of the Mississippi. A small escort of
U. S. infantry was ordered to accompany me, under Lieut. James
Allen, U. S. A., who, being a graduate of the West Point Military
Academy, undertook the departments of topography and trigonometry.
I secured the services of Dr. Houghton, as physician
and surgeon, and acting botanist and geologist&mdash;positions which
he had occupied on the prior expedition of 1831. The American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions were invited to
send an agent to observe the wants and condition of the Indian
tribes in these remote latitudes; who directed the Rev. Wm. T.
Boutwell to join me at St. Mary's. I charged myself especially
with inquiring into the Indian history and languages, statistics,
and general ethnography.</p>

<p>The expedition left the Sault de Ste. Marie on the 7th of June,
taking the route through Lake Superior to Fond du Lac and the
St. Louis River, and the Savanna Summit to Sandy Lake, which
lies 500 miles above St. Anthony's Falls of the Upper Mississippi.
The width of the Mississippi at the outlet of Sandy Lake, by a
line stretched across, was found to be 331 feet. At my camp
here, a general council was summoned of the lower tribes, who
were notified to assemble at the mouth of the River Des Corbeau
on the 20th of July; and a boat with presents and supplies was
sent down the Mississippi to await the return of the expedition
through that river. Lightened thus of baggage, and having fixed
a point of time within which to finish the explorations above, I
proceeded up the main channel of the river to, and across the
Pakagama Falls, and its wide plateau of savannas, and through
the Little and Great Winnipek Lakes, to the Upper Red Cedar,
or Cass Lake, which we entered on the 10th of July. This is a
fine lake of transparent water, about eighteen miles in length,
with several large bays and islands as denoted in the accompanying
sketch, which give it an irregular shape. The largest island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
called <i>Grande Isle</i> by the French, which is the <i>Gitchiminis</i> of the
Indians, and the <i>Colcaspi</i><a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[154]</a> of my initial narrative of 1832. This
lake was the terminus of the respective explorations of Lieutenant
Zebulon Pike, U. S. A., in 1806, and Governor Lewis Cass in
1820. The points at which they approached it were not, however,
the same. Pike visited it in a dog train, on the snow, in
the month of January, across the land, from the Northwest Company's
trading post at Leech Lake. He visited an out-station of
that company on Grand Island. Cass landed in July, after tracing
its channel from Sandy Lake to the entrance of Turtle River,
the line of communication to Turtle Lake, which was long the
reputed source of the river. This has been called by a modern
traveller in the region Lake Julia, that he might call it the <i>Julian</i>
source of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[155]</a></p>

<p>I found the Mississippi, at the point where it flows from the
lake, to be 172 feet wide, not having lost half the width it had at
Sandy Lake, although in this distance it is diminished by the
volume of its Leech Lake tributary, which the northwest agents
informed Lieutenant Pike, in 1806, to be its largest tributary. I
had reached it ten days earlier in the season than Governor Cass,
having been exactly one day less in traversing the long line of
intervening country from Sault de Ste. Marie. I proceeded directly
to Grand Isle, the residence of a Chippewa band numbering 157
persons. This island was found to have a fertile soil, where they
had always raised the zea maize. Its latitude is 47° 25´ 23´´.
Not only had I reached this point ten days earlier in the month
than the expedition of 1820, but it was found that the state of the
water on these summits was very favorable to their ascent. Ozawindib,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[156]</a>
the Chippewa chief, said that his hunting-grounds embraced
the source of the Mississippi, but that canoes of the size
and burden which I had could not ascend higher than the
<i>Pemidjegumaug</i>, or Queen Anne's Lake. I determined to encamp
my extra men permanently on this island, with the heavy canoes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>provisions, and baggage, leaving the camp in charge of Louis
Default, a trusty man, of the <i>metif</i> class, well acquainted with the
Indian language, who had been a guide in 1820, and to make
explorations, in the lightest class of Indian canoes, provisioned
for an _élite_ movement. Lieutenant Allen also determined to encamp
the United States soldiers of the party, leaving them under
a sergeant. To give each gentleman of the party an opportunity
of joining in this movement, it was necessary to procure five
hunting canoes, which were of no greater capacity than to bear
one <i>sitter</i><a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[157]</a> and two paddlers.</p>

<p>Ozawindib and his companions produced these canoes at an
early hour on the following morning, and having, at my request,
drawn a map of the route, embarked himself as the guide to the
party. We left the island before it was yet daylight. The party
now consisted of sixteen persons, including three Chippewas and
eight <i>engagees</i>. The Mississippi enters this lake through a savanna,
on its extreme western borders, after performing one of
those evolutions through meadow lands so common to its lower
latitudes; after reaching to within fifty yards of the lake, it winds
about, through a natural meadow, for many miles before its debouchure.
The chief, who was familiar with this feature, carried
me to a fifty yards portage, by which we saved some miles of
paddling. We reached the Mississippi at a place where it expands
into an elongated lake, for which I heard no name, and
which I called Lake Andrúsia.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[158]</a> After passing through this,
the river appeared very much in size and volume as it had on
the outlet below Cass Lake. It winds its way through the same
species of natural meadows, during which there is but little
current. On ascending this channel but a short distance, the
river is found to display itself in a second lake&mdash;which the natives
call Pamitascodiac<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[159]</a>&mdash;which, in general appearance and character,
may be deemed the twin of Lake Andrúsia. On its upper margin,
a tract of prairie land appears, of a sandy character, bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>scattered pines. This appears to be the particular feature alluded
to by the Indian name. About four miles above this lake, and
say fifteen from Cass Lake, the rapids commence. It was eight
o'clock A. M. when we reached this point, and we had then been
four hours in our canoes from the Andrúsia portage. These
rapids soon proved themselves to be formidable. Boulders of
the geological drift period are frequently encountered in ascending
them, and the river spreads itself over so considerable a surface
that it became necessary for the bowsmen and steersmen to
get out into the shallows and lead up the canoes. These canoes
were but of two fathoms length, drew but a few inches water, and
would not bear more than three persons. It was ten o'clock when
we landed, on a dry opening on the right shore, to boil our kettle,
and prepare breakfast. So dry, indeed, was the vegetation here,
that the camp-fire spread in the grass and leaves, and it required
some activity in the men to prevent its burning the baggage.
There were ten of these rapids encountered before we reached
the summit, or plateau, of Lake Pemidjegumaug, which is the
<i>Lac Traverse</i> of the French. These were called the Metóswa
rapids, from the Indian numeral for ten.</p>

<p>The term <i>Lac Traverse</i> has been repeated several times by the
Canadian French, in our northwestern geography; being prominently
known in the Upper Mississippi for a handsome sheet of
water, connecting the St. Peter's, or Minnesota River, with Red
River of Hudson's Bay; and as the Indian name, though very
graphic, is not euphonious, I named it Queen Anne's Lake.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[160]</a> It
is a clear and beautiful sheet of water, twelve miles in length,
from east to west, and six or seven broad, with an open forest of
hard wood. It is distant forty-five miles from Cass Lake, and
lies at an elevation of fifty-four feet above that lake, and of 1,456
feet above the Gulf of Mexico. The latitude is 47° 28´ 46´´.
The peculiarity recognized by the Indian name of Pemidjegumaug,
or Crosswater, is found to consist in the entrance of the
Mississippi into its extreme south end, and its passage through
or across part of it, at a short distance from the point of entrance.
Another feature of its topography consists of its connection, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>a lively channel of less than a mile's length, with another transverse
lake of pure waters, to which I applied the name of Washington
Irving. These features are shown by the subjoined
sketch.</p>

<p>A short halt was made on entering Queen Anne's Lake, to
examine an object of Indian superstition on its east shore. This
consisted of one of those water-worn boulders which assume the
shape of a rude image, and to which the Chippewas apply the
name <i>Shingabawassin</i>, or image-stone. Nothing artificial appeared
about it, except a ring of paint, of some ochreous matter, around
the fancied neck of the image.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[161]</a> We were an hour in crossing
the lake southwardly from this point, which would give a mean
rate of five miles. At the point of landing, stood a small, deserted,
long building, which Ozawindib informed me had been
used as a minor winter trading station. I observed on the beach
at this spot some small species of unios, and, at higher points on
the shore, helices. We here noticed the passenger pigeon.
The forest exhibited the elm, soft maple, and white ash. Proceeding
directly south from this spot a short distance, we entered
the Mississippi, which was found to flow in with a broad
channel and rapid current. This channel Lieutenant Allen estimated
to be but one hundred yards long, at which distance we
entered into a beautiful little lake of pellucid water and a picturesque
margin, spreading transversely to our track, to which I
gave the name of Irving. Ozawindib held his way directly
south through this body of water, striking the river again on
its opposite shore. We had proceeded but half a mile above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>this lake, when it was announced that we had reached the primary
forks of the Mississippi. We were now in latitude 47° 28´
46´´. Up to this point, the river had carried its characteristics
in a remarkable manner. Of the two primary streams before us,
the one flowing from the west, or the Itascan fork, contributes by
far the largest volume of water, possessing the greatest velocity
and breadth of current. The two streams enter each other at an
acute angle, which varies but little from due south, as denoted in
the diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-232.jpg" width="450" height="367" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Primary forks of the Mississippi River, in lat. 47° 28´ 46´´.</p>

<p>Ozawindib hesitated not a moment which branch to ascend,
but shooting his canoe out of the stronger current of the Itascan
fork, entered the other. His wisdom in this movement was soon
apparent. He had not only entered the shallower and stiller
branch, but one that led more directly to the base of the ultimate
summit of Itasca. This stream soon narrowed to twenty feet.
We could distinctly descry the moving sands at its bottom; but
its diminished velocity was apparent from the intrusion of aquatic
plants along its shores. It was manifest also from the forest
vegetation, that we were advancing into regions of a more alpine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
flora. The branches of the larches, spruce, and gray pines, were
clothed with lichens and floating moss to their very tops, denoting
an atmosphere of more than the ordinary humidity. Clumps of
gray willows skirted the margin of the stream.</p>

<p>It was found that the river had made its utmost northing in
Queen Anne's Lake. From the exit from that point, the course
was nearly due south, and from this moment to our arrival at the
ultimate forks, which cannot exceed a mile and a half or two
miles, it was evident why the actual source of this celebrated
river had so long eluded scrutiny. We were ascending at every
curve so far <i>south</i>, as to carry the observer out of every old line
of travel or commerce in the fur trade (the sole interest here), and
into a remote elevated region, which is never visited indeed, except
by Indian hunters, and is never crossed, even by them, to
visit the waters of the Red River&mdash;the region in immediate juxtaposition
north. This semi Alpine plateau, or height of land for
which we were now pushing directly, is called in the parlance of
the fur trade <i>Hauteurs de Terre</i>. It was evident that we were
ascending to this continental plateau by steps, denoted by a series
of rapids, presenting step by step, in regular succession, widespread
areas of flat surface spotted with almost innumerable
lakes, small and large, and rice-ponds and lagoons. Thus, after
surmounting the step of the Packagama Falls, we enter on a wide
and far stretching plateau which embraces the great area of Leech
Lake, and its numerous lacustrine beds. This step or plateau
may, in the descending order of the Mississippi, be called the fifth
plateau, and is, by barometrical observation, 1,356 feet above the
Gulf of Mexico. The next, or fourth step, is that of the plateau
of Cass Lake, caused chiefly by the lively waters of the Leech
Lake, the Upper Red Cedar, and the Winnepek outlets. The
Cass Lake level extends west of this lake to the foot of the
Metoswa rapids. This is forty-six feet above the Leech Lake
level. The third plateau, on which the Mississippi spreads itself,
is that of the Queen Anne summit, which is elevated by the Metoswa
rapids sixty-four feet above the former. We had now
entered on this third plateau, on which we found the river flowing
with a just perceptible current, and frequently expanding itself
in small lakes. On the first of these, after ascending the left
hand, or minor fork, I bestowed the name of Marquette; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the second, that of La Salle. We proceeded beyond these to
a third lake of larger dimension, which the Chippewas call
Kubba-Kunna, or the Rest in the Path, being the site of crossing
of one of their noted land-trails; I named it Lake Plantagenet.
Lt. Allen deemed this lake ten miles long and five wide. At a
point a short distance above the head of this lake, we encamped
at a late hour. It was now seven o'clock P. M., and we had been
in our canoes sixteen hours, and travelled fifty-five miles. It
was not easy to find ground dry enough to encamp on, and while
we were searching for it, rain commenced. We had pushed through
the ample borders of the Scirpus lacustris and other aquatic plants,
to a point of willows, alders, and spruce and tamarack, with
pinus banksiana in the distance. The ground was low and wet,
the foot sinking into a carpet of green moss at every tread.
The lower branches of the trees were dry and dead, exhibiting
masses of flowing gray moss. Dampness, frigidity, and gloom
marked the dreary spot, and when a camp fire had been kindled
it threw its red glare around on strange masses of thickets and
darkness, which might have well employed the pencil of a Michael
Angelo. Tired and overwearied men are not, however, much
given to the poetic on these occasions, and they addressed themselves
at once to the pacification of that uneasy organ, the
stomach. Travelling with men who strangely mix up two foreign
languages, one falls insensibly into the same jargon habits, of
which I convicted myself of a notable instance this evening. I
had on landing and pushing into the forest, laid a green morocco
portfolio on the branches of a little spruce, and could not find it.
<i>Kewau bemuasee</i>, I said to one of the men, <i>en petite chose ver, mittig
onsing</i>? Have you not seen a small green roll in a sapling? not
recollecting that the middle clause of the sentence, though in
regimen with the Ojibwa, could have only been construed by one
familiar both with the Canadian French and the Algonquin.
Such, however, proved to be the case, and he soon handed me
the missing portfolio.</p>

<p>I observed, as the crews of the several canoes threw down their
day's game before the cook, there was a species of duck, the anas
canadensis, I think, which had a small unio attached to one of its
mandibles, having been engaged in opening the shell at the
moment it was shot. With every aid, however, from the tent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the tea-kettle, and our cook's art in spitting ducks, the night
here, in a gloomy and damp thicket, just elevated above the line
of the river flags, and quite in the range of the frogs and lizards,
proved to be one of the most dreary and forlorn. It was felt that
we were no longer on the open Mississippi, but were winding up
a close and very serpentine tributary, nowhere over thirty feet
wide, which unfolded itself in a savanna, or bog, bordered closely
with lagoons and rice ponds. Indian sagacity, it was clear, had
led Ozawindib up this tributary as the best, shortest, and easiest
possible way of reaching to, and surmounting the Itasca plateau,
but it required a perpetual use of hand, foot, paddle, and pole; nor
was there a gleam of satisfaction to be found in anything but the
most intense onward exertion. Besides, I had agreed to meet the
Indians at the mouth of the Crow-Wing River on the 24th of
July, and that engagement must be fulfilled.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the next morning (12th) we were on our feet,
and resumed the ascent. The day was rainy and disagreeable.
There was little strength of current, but quite a sufficient depth
of water; the stream was excessively tortuous. Owing to the
sudden bends, we often frightened up the same flocks of brant, ducks,
and teals again and again, who did not appear to have been in
times past much subjected to these intrusions. The flora of this
valley appeared unfavorable. Dr. Houghton has reported a new
species of malva and some five or six other species or varieties
from the general region, but these have not, I think, been elaborately
described. The localities of the known species of fauna
might be marked by the occurrence, on this fork, of the cervus
virginianus, which had not been seen after leaving the Sandy
Lake summit till after getting above the primary forks, which
flow from the south and west.</p>

<p>We toiled all day without intermission from daybreak till dark.
The banks of the river are fringed with a species of coarse marshland
grass. Clumps of willows fringe the stream. Rush and
reed occupy spots favorable to their growth. The forest exhibits
the larch, pine, and tamarack. Moss attaches itself to everything.
Water-fowls seem alone to exult in their seclusion. After we
had proceeded for an hour above Lake Plantagenet, an Indian in
the advance canoe fired at and killed a deer. Although fairly
shot, the animal ran several hundred yards. It then fell dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The man who had killed it brought the carcass to the banks of
the river. The dexterity with which he skinned and cut it up,
excited admiration. He gave the <i>moze</i>, which I understood to
mean the hide and feet, to my guide, Ozawindib. Signs of this
animal were frequent along the stream. But we were impelled
forward by higher objects than hunting. It was, indeed, geographical
and scientific facts that we were hunting for. To trace
to its source an important river, and to fix the actual point of its
origin, furnished the mental stimulus which led us to care but
little where we slept or what we ate.</p>

<p>When the usual hour for breakfast arrived, the banks of the
river proved too marshy to land, and we continued on till a
quarter past twelve P. M., before a convenient landing could be
made. After this recruit to stomach and spirits, the men again
pushed forward, threading the stream as it wound about in a
savanna, seldom halting more than a few minutes at a time.
Frequently, a shot was fired at the numerous water-fowl, so abundant
on these waters. Sometimes a small unio or anadonta was
picked up from the shores; occasionally a plant pulled up, for the
botanical press. Nowhere was the water found too shallow for
our canoes, which were only embarrassed at some points by the
density of vegetable tissue. Rain showers were encountered
during the whole of the day, the equilibrium of the atmosphere
being disturbed by rolling, cumulous clouds, which often poured
down their contents with little warning, and without, indeed,
driving us from our canoes. For, on these occasions, where a
fixed point is to be made, and the showers are not anticipated to
be long or heavy, it is better to travel in the rain and submit to
the wetting, than to attempt landing. Neither can the meal of
dinner be stopped for. At length, at half past five o'clock in the
evening, we came to the base of the highlands of the Itasca or
Hauteurs de Terre summit. The flanks of this elevation revealed
themselves in a high, naked precipice of the drift and boulder
stratum, on the immediate margin of the stream which washed
against it. Our pilot, Ozawindib, was at the moment in the rear;
halting a few moments for him to come up, he said that we were
within a few hundred yards of the Naiwa rapids, and that the
portage around them commenced at this escarpment. We had
seen no rock of any species, in place, thus far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
A general landing was immediately made at the foot of the
hill, and as the five canoes came up the baggage was prepared in
bundles and packages for being carried, the canoe-paddles and
poles securely tied in bundles, and the canoes lifted from the water
and dried in the sun to make the transportation of them as light as
possible, and mended and pitched wherever they leaked. It was
found that the whole baggage, canoes and all, could be arranged
for eleven back-loads, this being the precise number of our
carriers, white and red; and being ready, Ozawindib led the way,
having a single canoe for his share, and he was soon followed by
the whole line, each one of our sitters falling in this line, charged
with the particular instrument of his observation, or record of it.
The hill was steep, and the footing soft and yielding in the crumbling
diluvion, and the scene, as the party struggled up the
ascent, presented quite a study for the picturesque. Lieutenant
Allen carried his canoe-compass, which I had had mounted by an
artisan of Detroit; Dr. Houghton grasped his hortus siccus under
his arms; Mr. Johnston, our interpreter, had his pipe and fowling-piece,
and Mr. Boutwell had wellnigh lost his pocket-bible and
notes, while staying himself against the treacherous influence of a
steep sand cliff. While the party thus took their way over the
hill to cross a peninsula of a mile or two, and strike the river
above the junction of the Naiwa River, I went to observe the
rapids. The river, at this point, is forced through a narrow
gorge, where the water descends with loud murmuring over a
series of rapids, which form a complete check to navigation. The
portage is two miles. I judged the entire descent of the channel,
from the beginning to the terminus of the portage, to be forty-eight
feet. Boulders of the peculiar northern sienite, highly
charged with hornblende, and of trap-rock, or greenstone, quartz,
and sandstone, were scattered over this elevation, and mixed with
the more finely comminuted portions of the same rocks, and of
amygdaloids and schistose fragments. Among these, I observed
some specimens of the zoned agate, which identifies the stratum
with the extensive drift formation of the upper Mississippi. It
would seem that extensive amygdaloidal strata formerly extended
over these heights, which have been broken down by the fierce and
general rush of the oceanic currents of the north, which once
manifestly swept over these elevations.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Darkness fell as we reached an elevation overlooking the river
above the Naiwa Rapids, and after some deliberation as to the spot
where we should suffer less annoyance from mosquitos, I proceeded
to the lower part of the valley near the river, and set up
my tent there for the night. On questioning Ozawindib of the
Naiwa River, he informed me that it was a stream of considerable
size, and that it originated in a lake on a distant part of the plateau,
which was infested with the copper-head snake; hence the
name. Mr. Allen's estimate of this day's journey was fifty-two
miles. We had reached the second, or Assawa plateau of the
Mississippi, which is, barometrically, seventy-six feet above the
Queen Anne summit, and now had but one more to surmount.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">The Expedition having reached the source of the east fork in Assawa Lake, crosses
the highlands of the Hauteurs de Terre to the source of the main or west fork in
Itasca Lake.</p>

<p>The next morning (13th) a dense fog prevailed. We had
found the atmosphere warm, but charged with water and vapors,
which frequently condensed into showers. The evenings and
nights were, however, cool, at the precise time of the earth
hiding the sun's disk. It was five o'clock before we could discern
objects with sufficient distinctness to venture to embark. We
found the channel of the river strikingly diminished on getting
above the Naiwa. Its width is that of a mere brook, running in
a valley half a mile wide. The water is still and pond-like, the
margin being encroached on by aquatic plants. It presents some
areas of the zizania palustris, and appeared to be the favorite resort
for several species of duck, who were continually disturbed
by our progress. After diligently ascending an hour and a half,
or about eight miles, the stream almost imperceptibly began to
open into a lake, which the Indians called Assawa, or Perch Lake.
Its borders are fringed with the <i>monomin</i> of the Chippewas, or
wild rice, and several of the liliaceous water plants. The water
is transparent when dipped up and viewed by the light, but from
the falling of leaves and other carbonaceous fibre to the bottom,
it reflects a sombre hue. We were just twenty minutes in passing
through it, denoting a length of perhaps two miles, and a width of
half a mile. Our course through it was directly south. Ozawindib,
who took the advance, entered an inlet, but had not ascended it
far, when he rested on his paddles, and exclaimed <i>o-omah mekunnah</i>,
here is the path, or portage. We had, in fact, traced this
branch of the river into its utmost sources. It was seven o'clock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>in the morning. We were surrounded by what the natives term
<i>azhiskee</i>, or mire, broad-leaved plants extending over the surface
of the water, in which I recognized a diminutive species of yellow
pond-lily. There was no mode of reaching dry land but by
stepping into this yielding azhiskee. The water was rather tepid.
After wading about fifty yards the footing became more firm, and
we soon began to ascend a slight elevation. Some traces of an
Indian trail appeared here, which led to an opening in the thicket,
where vestiges of the bones of birds, and old camp-poles, indicated
the prior encampment of Indians.</p>

<p>I had now traced this branch of the Mississippi to its source,
and was at the south base of the inter-continental highlands,
which give origin to the longest and principal branch of the Mississippi.
To reach its source it was necessary to ascend and cross
these. Of their height, and the difficulty of their ascent, we knew
nothing. This only was sure, from the representation of the
natives, that it could be readily done, carrying the small bark
canoes we had thus far employed. The chief said it was thirteen
<i>opugidjiwenun</i>, or putting-down-places, which are otherwise called
<i>onwaybees</i>, or rests. From the roughness of the path, not more
than half a mile can be estimated to each <i>onwaybee</i>. Assawa Lake
is shown, by barometric measurement, to be 1,532 feet above the
Gulf. Having followed out this branch to its source, its very
existence in our geography becomes a new fact.</p>

<p>While the baggage and canoes were being carried to the spot
of our encampment, a camp-fire was kindled and the cook busied
himself in preparing breakfast. The canoes were then carefully
examined and repaired, and the baggage parted into loads, so as
to permit the whole outfit and apparatus to be transported at one
trip. These things having been arranged, and the breakfast dispatched,
we set forward to mount the highlands. Ozawindib having
thrown one of the canoes over his shoulders, led the way,
complaisantly, being followed by the entire party.</p>

<p>The prevailing growth at this place is thick bramble, spruce,
white cedar, and tamarak. The path plunges at once into a
marshy and matted thicket, which it requires all one's strength
to press through&mdash;then rises to a little elevation covered with
white cedar, and again plunges into a morass strewed with fallen
and decayed logs, covered with moss. From this the trail emerges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
on dry ground. Relieved from the entanglement about our feet,
we soon found ourselves ascending an elevation of the drift stratum,
consisting of oceanic sand, with boulders. On the side of
this eminence we enjoyed our first <i>onwaybee</i>. The day had developed
itself clear and warm, and glad indeed were we to find
the chief had put down his canoe, and by the time we reached
had lit his pipe. The second onwaybee brought us to the summit
of this elevation; the third to the side of a ridge beyond it; the
fourth to another summit; in fine, we found ourselves crossing
a succession of ridges and depressions, which seemed to have
owed their original outlines to the tumultuous waves of some
mighty ocean, which had once had the mastery over the highlands.
Trail there was often none. The day being clear, the
chief, however, held his course truly, and when he was turned
out of it by some defile, or thicket, or bog, he again found his
line at the earliest possible point. In one of the depressions, we
crossed a little lake in the canoes; in another, we followed the
guide on foot, through and along the border of a shallow lake, to
avoid the density of the thickets.</p>

<p>Ripe strawberries were brought to me at one of our onwaybees.
I observed the diminutive rebus nutkanus on low grounds. The
common falco was noticed, and the Indians remarked tracks of
the deer, not, however, of very recent date. The forest growth
is small, by far the most common species being the scrubby pinus
banksianus, exhibiting its parasitic moss. The elevated parts of
the route were sufficiently open, with often steep ascents. Over
these sienite and granite, quartz and sandstone boulders were
scattered. Every step we made in crossing these sandy and
diluvial elevations, seemed to inspire renewed ardor in completing
the traverse. The guide had called the distance, as we
computed it, about six, or six and a half miles. We had been four
hours upon it, now clambering up steeps, and now brushing
through thickets, when he told us we were ascending the last
elevation, and I kept close to his heels, soon outwent him on
the trail, and got the first glimpse of the glittering nymph we
had been pursuing. On reaching the summit this wish was
gratified. At a depression of perhaps a hundred feet below,
cradled among the hills, the lake spread out its elongated volume,
presenting a scene of no common picturesqueness and rural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
beauty. In a short time I stood on its border, the whole cortege
of canoes and pedestrians following; and as each one came he deposited
his burden on a little open plat, which constituted the
terminus of the Indian trail. In a few moments a little fire
threw up its blaze, and the pan of <i>pigieu</i>, or pine pitch, was heated
to mend the seams of the bark canoes. When this was done,
they were instantly put into the lake, with their appropriate baggage;
and the little flotilla of five canoes was soon in motion,
passing down one of the most tranquil and pure sheets of water of
which it is possible to conceive. There was not a breath of wind.
We often rested to behold the scene. It is not a lake overhung
by rocks. Not a precipice is in sight, or a stone, save the pebbles
and boulders of the drift era, which are scattered on the beach.
The water-fowl, whom we disturbed in their seclusion, seemed
rather loath to fly up. At one point we observed a deer, standing
in the water, and stooping down, apparently to eat moss.</p>

<p>The diluvial hills inclosing the basin, at distances of one or two
miles, are covered with pines. From these elevations the lands
slope gently down to the water's edge, which is fringed with a mixed
foliage of deciduous and evergreen species. After passing some
few miles down its longest arm, we landed at an island, which
appeared to be the only one in the lake. I immediately had my
tent pitched, and while the cook exerted his skill to prepare a
meal, scrutinized its shores for crustacea, while Dr. Houghton
sought to identify its plants. While here, the latter recognized
the mycrostylis ophioglossoides, physalis lanceolata, silene antirrhina,
and viola pedata. We found the elm, lynn, soft maple,
and wild cherry, mingled with the fir species.</p>

<p>An arm of the lake stretches immediately south from this
island, which receives a small brook. Lieutenant Allen, who
estimates the greatest length of the lake at seven miles, drew the
following sketch of its configuration. (See p. <a href="#Page_243">243.</a>)</p>

<p>The latitude of this lake is 47° 13´ 35´´.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[162]</a> The highest grounds
passed over by us, in our transit from the Assowa Lake, lie at an
elevation of 1,695 feet. The view given of the scene in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>volume of my <i>Ethnological Researches</i>, p. 146, is taken from a point
north of the island, looking into the vista of the south arm of the
lake. I inquired of Ozawindib the Indian name of this lake; he
replied <i>Omushkös</i>, which is the Chippewa name of the Elk.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[163]</a>
Having previously got an inkling of some of their mythological
and necromantic notions of the origin and mutations of the country,
which permitted the use of a female name for it, I denominated
it <span class="smcap">Itasca</span>.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[164]</a></p>

The line of discovery of the Mississippi, explored above Cass
Lake, taking the east fork from the primary junction, as shown
by Mr. Allen's topographical notes, is one hundred and twenty-three
miles.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[166]</a> This is the shortest and most direct branch. The
line by the Itascan or main branch of it is, probably, some twenty
or twenty-five miles longer. It is evident, as before intimated,
that the river descends from its summit in plateaux. From the
pseudo-alpine level of the parent lake, there is a principal and
minor rapids, for the former of which the Indians have the appropriate
name of <i>Kakabikons</i>, which is a descriptive term for a cascade
over rocks or stones. Then the river again deploys itself in a lake
and a series of minor lakes on the same level, and this process is
repeated, until it finally plunges over the horizontal rocks at St.
Anthony's Falls, and displays itself, for the last time, in Lake
Pepin. Commencing with the latter lake, it may be observed
for the purposes of generalization, and to give definite notions
rather of its hydrography than geology, that there are nine plateaux,
of which Governor Cass, in 1820, explored six. The other
three, beginning at his terminal point, have now been indicated.
The heights of these are given, barometrically. The distances
travelled are given from time. The annexed diagram of these
plateaux, extending to the Pakagama summit, will impress these
deductions on the eye.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>The length of the Mississippi, from the Gulf of Mexico, pursuing
its involutions, may be stated to be three thousand miles.
By estimates from the best sources made, respectively, during
the expeditions of 1820 and 1832, it is shown to have a winding
thread of three thousand one hundred and sixty miles. Taking
the barometrical height of Itasca Lake at fifteen hundred and
seventy-five feet, it has a mean descent of a fraction over six
inches per mile. As one of the most striking epochs in American
geography, we have known this river, computing from the
era of Marquette's discovery to the present day (July 13, 1832), but
one hundred and fifty-nine years&mdash;a short period, indeed! How
rich a portion of the geology of the globe lies buried in the flora
and fauna of the tertiary, the middle or secondary, and the palæozoic
eras of its valley, we have hardly begun to inquire. It will,
<i>doubtless</i>, and, so far as we know, <i>does</i>, contribute evidences to the
antiquity and mutations of the earth's surface, conformably to the
progress of discoveries in other parts of the globe. The immense
basins of coal, found in the middle and lower parts of its valley,
prove the same gigantic epoch of its flora which has been established
for the coal measures of Europe,<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[167]</a> and sweep to the winds
the jejune theory that the continent arose from a chaotic state, at
a period a whit less remote than the other quarters of the globe.
While the large bones of its later eras, found imbedded in its
unconsolidated strata, prove how large a portion of its fauna were
involved in the gigantic and monster-period.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Descent of the west, or Itascan branch&mdash;Kakabikoñs Falls&mdash;Junction of the Chemaun,
Peniddiwin, or De Soto, and Allenoga Rivers&mdash;Return to Cass Lake.</p>

<p>Itasca Lake lies in latitude twenty-five seconds only south of
Leech Lake, and five minutes and eleven seconds west of the ultimate
northerly point of the Mississippi, on the Queen Anne
summit; it is a fraction over twelve minutes southwest of Cass
Lake. The distance from the latter point, at which discovery
rested in 1820, is, agreeably to the observations of Lieutenant
Allen, one hundred and sixty-four miles.</p>

<p>On scrutinizing the shores of the island, on which I had encamped,
innumerable helices, and other small univalves, were
found; among these I observed a new species, which Mr. Cooper
has described as planorbis companulatus.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[168]</a> There were bones of
certain species of fish, as well as the bucklers of one or two kinds
of tortoise, scattered around the sites of old Indian camp fires,
denoting so many points of its natural history. Amidst the forest-trees
before named, the betula papyraceæ and spruce were observed.
Directing one of the latter to be cut down, and prepared
as a flagstaff, I caused the United States flag to be hoisted on it.
This symbol was left flying at our departure. Ozawindib, who at
once comprehended the meaning of this ceremony, with his companions
fired a salute as it reached its elevation.</p>

<p>Having made the necessary examinations, I directed my tent to
be struck, and the canoes put into the water, and immediately
embarked. The outlet lies north of the island. Before reaching
it, we had lost sight of the flagstaff, owing to the curvature of the
shore. Unexpectedly, the outlet proved quite a brisk brook, with
a mean width of ten feet, and one foot in depth. The water is as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>clear as crystal, and we at once found ourselves gliding along,
over a sandy and pebbly bottom, strewed with the scattered
valves of shells, at a brisk rate. Its banks are overhung with
limbs and foliage, which sometimes reach across. The bends are
short, and have accumulations of flood-wood, so that, from both
causes, the use of the axe is often necessary to clear a passage.
There was also danger of running against boulders of black rock,
lying in the margin, or piled up in the channel. As the rapid
waters increased, we were hurled, as it were, along through the
narrow passages, and should have descended at a prodigiously
rapid rate, had it not been for these embarrassments to the navigation.
Its course was northwest. After descending about ten
miles, the river enters a narrow savanna, where the channel is
wider and deeper, but equally circuitous. This reaches some
seven or eight miles. It then breaks its way through a pine ridge,
where the channel is again very much confined and rapid, the
velocity of the stream threatening every moment to dash the
canoe into a thousand pieces. The men were sometimes in the
water, to guide the canoe, or stood ever ready, with poles, to fend
off. After descending some twenty-five miles, we encamped on a
high sandy bluff on the left hand.</p>

<p>The next morning (14th), we were again in our canoes before
five o'clock. The severe rapids continued, and were rendered
more dangerous by limbs of trees which stretched over the
stream, threatening to sweep off everything that was movable.
We had been one hour passing down a perfect defile of rapids,
when we approached the Kakabikoñs Falls. <i>Kakábik</i>,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[169]</a> in the
Chippewa, means a cascade, or shoot of water over rocks. <i>Oñs</i>
is merely the diminutive, to which all the nouns of this language
are subject. How formidable this little cataract might be, we
could not tell. It appeared to be a swift rush of water, bolting
through a narrow gorge, without a perpendicular drop, and Ozawindib
said it required a portage. Halting at its head, for Lieut.
Allen to come up, his bowsman caught hold of my canoe, to
check his velocity. It had that effect. But, being checked sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>denly,
the stern of his canoe swung across the stream, which permitted
the steersman to catch hold of a branch. Thus stretched
tensely across the rapid stream, in an instant the water swept over
its gunwale, and its contents were plunged into the swift current.
The water was about four feet deep. Allen and his men found
footing, with much ado, but his canoe-compass, apparatus, and
everything, was lost and swept over the falls. He grasped his
manuscript notes, and, by feeling with his feet, fetched up his
fowling-piece; the men clutched about, and managed to save the
canoe. Fortunately, I had a fine instrument to replace the lost
compass, though wanting the nautical rig of the other.</p>

<p>We made a short portage. Two of the canoes, with Indian
pilots, went down the rapids, but injured their canoes so much as
to cause a longer delay than if they had carried them by land.
Below this fall, the river receives a tributary on the right hand,
called the <i>Chemaun</i>, or Ocano. It contributes to double its
volume, very nearly, and hence its savanna borders are enlarged.
Conspicuous among the shrubbery on its shores are the wilding
rose and clumps of the salix. The channel winds through these
savanna borders capriciously. At a point where we landed for
breakfast, on an open pine bank on the left shore, we observed
several copious and clear springs pouring into the river. Indeed,
the extensive sand ranges which traverse the woodlands of the
Itasca plateau are perfectly charged with the moisture which is
condensed on these elevations, which flows in through a thousand
little rills. On these sandy heights the conifera predominate.</p>

<p>The physical character of the stream made this part of our
route a most rapid one. Willing or unwilling, we were hurried
on; but, indeed, we had every desire to hasten the descent. At
four o'clock P. M., we came to the junction of the Piniddiwin,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[170]</a> or
Carnage River, a considerable tributary on the left. On this
river, which originates in a lake, on the northeastern summit of
the Hauteur des Terres, I bestowed the name of De Soto. It has
also a lake, called Lac la Folle, at the point of its junction with
the Mississippi, whose borders are noted for the abundant and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>vigorous growth of wild rice, reeds, and rushes. It is called
Monomina,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[171]</a> by the Chippewas. By this accession, the width and
depth of the river are strikingly increased. The Indian reed first
appears at this spot.</p>

<p>While passing through this part of the river, I observed a singular
trait in the habits of the onzig duck, which, on being
suddenly surprised by the traveller, affects for the moment to be
disabled; flapping its wings on the water, as if it could not rise,
in order to allow its brood, who are now (July) unfledged, to
escape, when the mother instantly rises from the water, and wings
her flight vigorously. We observed, sailing above the marshy
areas of this fork, the falco furcatus, the feathers of which are
much esteemed by the Indians, for this is considered a brave
species, as its habit is to seize serpents by the neck, who twist
themselves around its elongated body, while it flies off to some
convenient perch to devour them. The deer is also noticed along
the Itascan fork. Ozawindib landed a little below the junction
of the Chemaun, to fire at one of them, which he discovered
grazing at some distance; but, although he carefully landed and
crept up crouchingly, he failed in his shot, either from the distance
or some other cause. Immediately, he put a fresh charge of
powder in his gun, and threw in a bullet, unwadded, and fired again
before the animal had made many leaps, but it held its way.</p>

<p>We descended about eighteen miles below the Piniddiwin, and
landed to encamp. The day's descent had been an arduous one.
Lieut. Allen estimated it at seventy-five miles. We had now
fairly followed the Mississippi out of what may be denoted its
Alpine passes. All its dangerous rapids had been overcome. It
was now a flowing stream of sixty feet wide. Immediately on
landing, one of the Indians captured an animal of the saurian
type, called <i>ocaut-e-kinabic</i>,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[172]</a> eight inches in length, striped blue,
black, and white, with four legs of equal length. The colors
were very vivid.</p>

<p>Having reached a part of the stream which could be safely
navigated, I resolved to re-embark after supper, and continue the
descent by night. We were now about fifteen miles above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>primary forks. Lieut. Allen determined to remain till daylight,
in order to trace the river down to the point at which it had been
left in the ascent. Nothing of an untoward nature occurred. A
river of some size enters, on the left hand, about six miles below
the saurian encampment, which originates in a lake. This stream,
for which I heard no name, I designated <i>Allenoga</i>, putting the
Iroquois local terminal in <i>oga</i> to the name of the worthy officer
who traced out the first true map of the actual sources of the
Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[173]</a> We passed the influx of the east fork, about half-past
one A. M. on the 15th, traversed the Lake of Queen Anne, and
descended the whole series of the Metoswa rapids, to Lake Andrúsia,
by the hour of daybreak, and reached the island of my
primary encampment, in Cass Lake, at nine o'clock in the morning.
We had been eleven hours and a half in our canoes, from the time
of re-embarkation at the camp above Allenoga. Lieut. Allen did
not rejoin us till six o'clock in the afternoon. He estimated the
entire distance, <i>out</i> and <i>in</i>, at 290 miles, it being 125 miles to
Itasca Lake, and, as before intimated, 165 miles from thence to
Cass Lake. He estimates the length of the Mississippi, above the
Falls of St. Anthony, at 1,029 miles. Taking the distance from
the Gulf of Mexico to the Falls at 2,200 miles,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[174]</a> this would give
to this stream a development of 3,229 miles, which exceeds my
prior estimates more than fifty miles.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">The expedition proceeds to strike the source of the great Crow-Wing River, by the
Indian trail and line of interior portages, by way of Leech Lake, the seat of the
warlike tribe of the Pillagers, or Mukundwa.</p>

<p>Having, while at Sandy Lake, summoned the Indians to meet
me in council at the mouth of the <i>L'aile de Corbeau</i>, or Crow-Wing
River, on the 20th of July, no time was to be lost in proceeding to
that place. The 15th, being the Sabbath, was spent at the island,
where the Rev. Mr. Boutwell addressed the Indians. The next
day, I met the Cass Lake band in council, and, having finished
that business, rewarded the Indians for their services and canoes
on the trip to Itasca Lake, distributed the presents designed for
them, replied to a message from Nezhopenais of Red Lake, and
invested Ozawindib with the President's largest silver medal and
a flag, and was ready by 10 o'clock A. M. to embark. Dr.
Houghton employed the time to complete his vaccinations. I
rewarded Mr. Default for taking charge of my camp during the
journey to Itasca Lake. As well to shorten the line of travel as
to visit an entirely unexplored section of the country, I resolved
to pursue the Indian trail and line of interior portages from Cass
to Leech Lake, and from the latter to the source of the great Crow-Wing
fork.</p>

<p>Passing southwardly across the lake, between Red Cedar and
Garden Islands, we have a prolonged bay running deep into the
land, toward the south. This bay is in the direct line to Leech
Lake; and as it had been crossed on the ice in January, 1806, by
Lieutenant Pike, in his adventurous and meritorious journey of
exploration, I called it Pike's Bay. It was twelve o'clock, meridian,
when we debarked at its head. The portage commenced
on the edge of an open pine forest, interspersed with scrub oak.
The path is deeply worn, in the sand-plain, and looks as if it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
been trod by the Indians for centuries. I observed, as we passed
along, the alum root, hyacinthus, and sweet fern, with the ledum
latifolium, vaccinium dumosum, and more common species of pine
plains. The pinus resinosa assumes here a larger size, and the
Indians pointed out to me markings and pictographs drawn with
charcoal, and covered with the resin of the tree, which were made
by the Indian tribe who preceded them in the occupancy of the
sources of the Mississippi. This must have been, if I rightly apprehend
their history, prior to A. D. 1600. That such markings
should be preserved by the pitch, which sheds the rain, is, however,
probable. They were of the totemic character, <i>i.e.</i> relating
to the exploits or achievements of groups of families, in which
the individual actor sinks his specific in the generic family or
clan name. Antiquities of this character are certainly a new
feature in Indian history. Letters have perfectly preserved the
landing of Cartier at the mouth of the St. Lawrence in 1534.
Pictography here records, that certain clans had killed bears and
taken human scalps before that time. And the fact is deeply
important in shedding light on Indian history and character; for
the killing of deers and bears, and the taking of human scalps, is
precisely what these tribes are doing at the present time. In the
three hundred years' interval, they have made no mental progress.
The Chippewa is just as fierce to-day, in hunting a Dacota scalp,
as the Dacota is in hunting a Chippewa scalp. The conquering
tribe has, however, pushed the Dacotas nearly one thousand miles
down the Mississippi.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Talk of your Hannibals, Napoleons, and Alps,</p>
<p>My glory," quoth the feathered hunter, "is in scalps."</p>
</div></div>

<p>After following the deeply indented path nine hundred and
fifty yards, we reached a small lake which disclosed, as we passed
it, patches of a dark, coarse, mossy-like substance at its bottom.
On reaching down with their paddles, the men brought up a singular
species of aquatic plant with coral-shaped branches. After
crossing this lake, the pine plain resumed its former character.
There was then a shallow bog of fifty or sixty yards. The rest
of the path consists of an arid sand plain, which is sometimes
brushy, but generally presents dry, easy travelling. We had
walked four thousand one hundred yards, or about two and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
half miles, when we reached an elongated body of clear living
water, having its outflow into Leech Lake. Embarking on this,
we crossed it, and entered a narrow stream, winding about in a
shaking savanna, where it was found difficult to veer the large
five-fathom canoes in which we now travelled. This tortuous
stream was joined by a tributary from the right, and at no remote
distance, entered an elongated duplicate body of water, named by
the Indians <i>Kapuka Sagatawag</i>, or the Abrupt Discharges.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[175]</a>
Below the junction of these lakes, which appear to be outbursts
from the Hauteur de Terre range, the stream is a wide-flowing
river. Its shores abound in sedge, reeds, and wild rice. The last
glimpses of daylight left us as this broad river entered into
Leech Lake. Moonlight still served us, as we began the traverse
of this spreading sea, but it soon became overcast, and it was intensely
dark before we reached the recurved point of land of the
principal chief's village. It was now ten o'clock at night, and it
was eleven before the military canoes, under Lieutenant Allen,
came up. In the morning a salute was fired by the Indians, who
welcomed us. Aishkebuggekozh,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[176]</a> or the Flat-mouth, the reigning
chief, invited me to breakfast. As this chief exercises a kind
of imperial sway over the adjacent country, it was important to
respect him. Having sent a dish of hard bread before me, I took
my interpreter and went to his residence. I found him living in
a tenement built of logs, with two rooms, well floored and roofed,
with two small glass windows. At one end of the breakfast-room
were extended his flags, medals, and warlike paraphernalia. In
the centre of the floor, a large mat of rushes, or Indian-woven
<i>apukwa</i> was spread, and upon this the breakfast and breakfast
things were arranged in an orderly manner. There were teacups,
teaspoons, plates, knives and forks, all of plain English manufacture.
A salt-cellar contained salt and pepper mixed in unequal
proportions. There were just as many plates as expected guests.
A large white fish, boiled, and cut up in good taste, occupied
a dish in the centre. There was a dish of sugar made from
the acer saccharinum. There were no stools, or chairs, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>small apukwa mats were spread for each guest. I observed the
dish of hard bread, which came opportunely, as there was no
other representative form of bread. The chief sat down at the head
of his breakfast, in the oriental fashion. Imitating his example,
I sat down with a degree of repose and nonchalance, as if this
had been the position I had practised from childhood. His empress&mdash;Equa,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[177]</a>
sat on one side, near him, to pour out the tea, but
neither ate nor drank anything herself. Her position was also
that of the oriental custom for females; that is, both feet were
thrown to one side, and doubled beside her.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[178]</a> The chief helped
us to fish and to tea, taking the cups from his wife. He was dignified,
grave, yet easy, and conversed freely, and the meal passed
off agreeably and without a pause, or the slightest embarrassment.
This was, perhaps, owing in part to my having been acquainted
with him before, he having visited me at my agency at
Sault Ste. Marie in 1828, and sat as a guest at my own table.
Nor, in a people so loath to give their confidence as the Indian, is
the fact undeserving of mention, of general affiliation to the tribe,
caused by my marriage with a grand-daughter of the ruling chief
of Lake Superior, a lady of refinement and intelligence, who was
the child of a gentleman of Antrim, Ireland, where she was educated.</p>

<p>On rising to leave, I invited him to a council, at my tent,
which was ordered to assemble at the firing of the military. It
is not unimportant to observe, that, in preparing to set out on this
expedition into the Indian country, at a time when the Blackhawk
had raised the standard of revolt on Rock River, and the
tribes of the Upper Mississippi were believed to be extensively
in his views, I had caused my canoe, after it had been finished in
most perfect style of art known to this kind of vessel, to be
painted with Chinese vermilion, from stem to stern. Ten years'
residence among the tribes, in an official capacity, had convinced
me that fear is the controlling principle of the Indian mind, and
that the persuasions to a life of peace, are most effectively made
under the symbols of war. To beg, to solicit, to creep and cringe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>to this race, whether in public or private, is a delusive, if not a
fatal course; and though I was told by one or two of my neighbors
that it was not well, on this occasion, to put my canoe in
the symbolic garb of war, I did not think so. I carried, indeed,
emphatically, messages of peace from the executive head of the
Government, and had the means of insuring respect for these
messages, by displaying the symbol of authority at the stern of
each vessel, by an escort of soldiery, and by presents, and the
services of a physician to arrest one of the most fatal of diseases
which have ever afflicted the Indian race. But I carried them fearlessly
and openly, with the avowed purpose of peace. The canoe,
itself, was an emblem of this authority, and, like the <i>oriflamme</i>
of the Mediæval Ages, cast an auspicious influence on my mission
over these bleak and wide summits, lakes, and forests, inhabited
alone by fierce and predatory tribes, who acknowledged no power
but force. Long before I had reached the sources of the Mississippi,
St. Vrain, my fellow agent, had been most cruelly murdered
at his agency, and General Scott, with the whole disposable army
of the United States, had taken the field at Chicago.</p>

<p>Lieut. Allen paraded his men that morning with burnished
arms. We could not, jointly, in an emergency, muster over forty
men, of whom a part were not reliable in a melée, but arranged
our camp in the best manner to produce effect. Effect, indeed, it
required, when the hour of the council came. Not less than one
thousand souls, men, women, and children, surrounded my tent,
including a special deputation from the American borders of
Rainy Lake. Of these, two hundred were active young warriors,
who strode by with a bold and lofty air, and glistening eyes, often
lifting the wings of my tent, to scan the preparations going forward.
Aishkebuggekozh entered the council area, having in his
train Majegabowi, the man who had led the revolt in the Red
River settlement of Lord Selkirk, and who had tomahawked Gov.
Semple, after he fell wounded from his horse. This association
did not smack of peaceful designs. The chief, Aishkebuggekozh,
himself, has the countenance of a very ogre. He is over six feet
high, very brawny, and stout. That feature of his countenance
from which he is named Flat-mouth, consisting of a broad expansion
and protrusion of the front jaws, between the long incision
of the mouth, reminds one much of a bull-dog's jaw. He held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
his hand, suspended by ribbons, five silver medals, smeared with
vermilion, to symbolize blood.</p>

<p>A person not familiar with Indian symbols, might deem such
signs alarming. I knew him to be very fond of using these symbols,
and, indeed, a man who never made a speech without them;
and I had the fullest confidence that, while he aimed to produce
the fullest effect upon his listening, but less shrewd tribe of folks,
and upon all, indeed, he never dreamed of an act which should
bring him into conflict with the United States. Like Blackhawk,
who was now exciting and leading the tribes at lower points to
war, he had, from his youth, been in the British interests. He
displayed a British flag at his breakfast, and three of his medals
were of British coinage, but he was a man of far more comprehensive
mind and understanding than Blackhawk.</p>

<p>Having been, as a government agent, the medium of the agreement
of the Chippewas and Sioux in fixing on a boundary line
for their respective territories at the treaty of Prairie-du-Chien, in
1825, I made that agreement, on the present occasion, the basis of
my remarks, for their preserving in good faith the stipulations of
that treaty, and of renewing the principles of it in the points
where they had since been broken and violated. I concluded by
assuring them of the friendship of the United States, of which my
visit to this remote region must be deemed proof, and of the sincerity
with which I had communicated the words of the President.
The presents were then delivered and distributed.</p>

<p>Aishkebuggekozh, or the Guelle Plat, replied, with much of the
skill and force of Indian oratory. He began by calling the attention
of the warriors to his words; he then turned to me, thanking
me for the presents. He said that he had been present when Pike
visited this lake in 1806. He pointed with his fingers across the
lake, to the Ottertail Point, where the old trading-house of the
British Northwest Company had stood. "You have come," he
continued, "to remind us that the American flag is now flying
over the country, and to offer us counsels of peace. I thank you.
I have heard that voice before, but it was like a rushing wind. It
was strong, but soon went. It did not remain long enough to
choke up the path. At the treaty of Prairie-du-Chien, it had been
promised that whoever crossed the lines, the long arms of the
President should pull them back; but, that very year, the Sioux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
attacked us, and they have killed my people almost every year
since. I was myself present when they fired on a peaceful
delegation, and killed four Chippewas under the walls of Fort
Snelling. My own son&mdash;my <i>only</i> son&mdash;has been killed. He was
basely killed, without an opportunity to defend himself." A subordinate
here handed him, at his request, a bundle of small sticks.
"This," handing them to me, "is the number of Leech Lake Chippewas
killed by the Sioux since the treaty of Prairie-du-Chien."
There were forty-three sticks.</p>

<p>He then lifted up a string of silver medals, smeared with vermilion.
"Take notice, they are bloody. I wish you to wipe the
blood off. I cannot do it. I find myself in a war with this people,
and I believe it has been intended by the Creator that we should
be at war with them. My warriors are brave [looking significantly

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Geographical account of Leech Lake&mdash;History of its Indians, the Mukundwas&mdash;The
expedition proceeds to the source of the Crow-Wing River, and descends
that stream, in its whole length, to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Leech Lake is a large, deep, and very irregularly-shaped body
of water. It cannot be less than twenty miles across its extreme
points. I requested the chief to draw its outlines, furnishing a
sheet of foolscap. He began by tracing a large ellipsis, and then
projecting large points and bays, inwardly and outwardly, with
seven or eight islands, and that peculiar feature, the Kapuka
Sagotawa, which I apprehend to originate in gigantic springs.
The following eccentric figure of the lake is the result.</p>

<p>This lake has been the seat of the Mukundwa, or Pillagers,
from early days. The date of their occupancy is unknown. The
French found them here early in the seventeenth century, when
they began to push the fur trade from Montreal. They were the
advance of the Algonquin group, who, when they had reached
the head of Lake Superior, proceeded still towards the west and
northwest. Two separate bodies assumed the advance in this
migratory movement, one of which went from the north shore,
at the old Grand Portage, north-northwest, by the way of the
Rainy Lakes, and the other went northwest from Fond du Lac.
The former soon earned for themselves the title of Killers, or
Kenistenos,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[180]</a> and speak a distinct dialect; the other, whose
language continued to be, with little variations, good Odjibwa,
acquired in a short time the name of Takers, or Mukundwa. The
Kenistenos advanced, through the Great Lake Winnepeck, and
up its inflowing waters, to the Portage du Trait, of the great
Churchill or Missi-nepi (much water) River, where they sent up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>a skinned frog, in derision of the feebler Athapasca race, whom
they here encountered. <i>Mackenzie's Voyages</i>, p. lxxiii. <i>Hist. Fur</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
<i>Trade</i>. The Odjibwas were led from Chegoimegon, in Lake Superior,
by two noted chiefs, called Nokay and Bainswah, under whom
they drove the Sioux from the region of Sandy Lake and the
source of the Mississippi. (<i>Ethnological Researches</i>, vol. ii. p. 135.)</p>

<p>Another party of this Algonquin force, which conquered the
country lying round the sources of the Mississippi, proceeded
through the Turtle River to Red Lake, and thence descended into
the valley of the Red River of Hudson's Bay, where their
descendants still reside. Large portions of these mingled with
the Canadian stock, forming that remarkable people called Boisbrules.
These advanced parties pressed into the buffalo plains,
along the Rivers Assinabwoin and Saskatchawine, which is the
ultimate western area of the spread of the Algonquin language.
And to this migration the Blackfeet are believed to be indebted
for the intermixture of this language which exists, and which
Mr. Gallatin has erroneously supposed to arise from original elements,
in the Blackfeet tongue.</p>

<p>This lake yields in abundance the corregonus albus, a fish
which is unknown to the Mississippi, and which delights only,
it appears, in very limpid and cold waters.</p>

<p>I found the population living at this lake to be eight hundred
and thirty-two souls, under three chiefs, the Guelle Plat, Nesia, or
the Elder Brother, and Chianoquet, or the Big Cloud, the latter
of whom is exclusively a war chief. Having dined these chiefs
at my tent, and finished my business, and the vaccinations and
very numerous cases of odontalgia being got through with, I
directed my canoes to be put in the water, with the view of going
a few miles down the shore, in order to get a quiet night's
encampment, and be ready for an early start on the morrow. It
was near the hour of sunset before we could embark. Aiskebuggekozh
came down to the boat to take leave of me. He was
dressed, on this occasion (having been in Indian costume all the
morning), in a blue military frock coat, with scarlet collar and
cuffs, white underclothes, a ruffled shirt, shoes and stockings, and
a citizen's hat. He was accompanied by Nesia and other followers,
and it appeared to me if there ever was a person who
had popular and undisputable claims to imperial sway, notwithstanding
this poor taste in costume, it was he.</p>

<p>We went about five miles in the general direction towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the source of the L'ail de Corbeau, and encamped. Dr. Houghton,
who had been left behind with Lieut. Allen, to complete the vaccinations,
rejoined me about seven o'clock. Guelle Plat had promised
to send me guides, to cross the country to the Crow-Wing
River, early the next morning (18th), but, as they did not arrive,
I proceeded across the arm of the lake for the main shore without
them. After reaching it, some time was spent in searching for
the commencement of the portage path. It was found to lie
across a dry pine plain. The Canadians, who are quick on finding
the trail of a portage, wanted nothing more, but pushed on,
canoes and baggage, without any further trouble about the Indian
guides. A portage of 1,078 yards brought us to the banks of a
small, clear, shallow lake, called Warpool, which had a very narrow,
tortuous outlet, through which the men, with great difficulty,
and by cutting away acute turns of the bank with their paddles,
made way to force the canoes into Little Long Lake, which we
were twenty-four minutes in crossing. The outlet from this lake
expanded, at successive intervals, into three pond-like lakes, redolent
with the nymphæ valerata; the series terminating in a
fourth lake, lying at the foot of elevated lands, which was called
the Lake of the Mountain. At the head of the latter, we debarked
on a shaking bog. At this spot commences the portage
<i>Plé</i>, which lies over a woodless and bleak hill. It is short and
abrupt, and terminates on the banks of a deep bowl-shaped lake,
where we took breakfast at twelve o'clock. We were now at the
foot of elevated lands. Here began the mountain portage, so
called. Its extent is, first, nine hundred and ten yards, terminating
on the shores of a little lake, without outlet, called the Lake of
the Isle. There is then a portage of 1,960 yards to another
mountain lake, without outlet. We were now near the apex of
the summit between Leech Lake and the source of De Corbeau.
Another portage of one onwaybee or about a thousand yards,
partly through a morass, carried us quite across this summit, and
brought us out on elevated and highly beautiful grounds overlooking
the Kaginogumaug, or Longwater Lake, which is the
source of the Crow-Wing River. Here we encamped (18th).</p>

<p>There is no rock stratum seen in place, on the De Corbeau
summit. Its surface is purely composed of geological drift and
boulders. The journey had been a very hard and fatiguing one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
for the men, who were on the push and trot all day, embarking
and debarking continually on lakes, or scrambling, with their
burdens and canoes, over elevations or through morasses. It
was particularly severe on the soldiers, who are ill-prepared for
this kind of toil.</p>

<p>The chief Guelle Plat, with some companions of the Mukandwa
band, had overtaken us, at the Lake of the Isle, and came
and encamped beside us. I invited him to sup with us, and the
evening was passed in conversing with him on various topics. I
found him a man of understanding and comprehensive views,
who was well acquainted with the history of his people. It was
twelve o'clock before these conversations ended, when he got up
to go to his camp fire. With him there sat Majegabowee,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[181]</a> a tall,
gaunt, and savage-looking man of Red River, who scarcely
uttered a word, but sat a silent listener to the superior powers of
conversation and reflection of his chief. But I could not look at
this person without a sense of horror, when I reflected that in
him I beheld the murderer of Gov. Semple, of the Hudson's
Bay Territory, a circumstance which I have previously adverted
to, while at Leech Lake.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[182]</a></p>

<p>Bidding adieu to the Leech Lake chief the next morning at sunrise
(4 h. 45 m.), after giving him a lancet, with directions to vaccinate
any of his people who had been overlooked, I embarked on
the Kaginogamaug. This is a beautiful lake, with sylvan shores
and crystal water, some four or five miles long. We were just
forty minutes, with full paddles, in passing it. The outlet is
narrow, and overhung with alders. The width is not over six
feet, with good depth, but the turns are so sudden, and the stream
so thickly overhung with foliage, that the use of the axe and the
paddle as an excavator were often necessary. It then expands
into a lake, called Little Vermilion, which is fringed with a
growth of birch and aspen, with pines in the distance. Its outlet
is fully doubled in width, and we had henceforth no more embarrassment
in descending. This outlet is pursued about eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>miles. I noticed the tamarack on its banks, and the nymphæ
odorata, scirpus lacustris, and Indian reed on the margin. It
expands into Birch Lake, a clear sheet, about one mile long,
with pebbly bottom, interspersed with boulders. A short outlet,
in which we passed a broken fish-dam, connects it with Lac Plè.
This lake is about three and a half miles long, exhibiting a portion
of prairie on its shores, interspersed with small pines. From
it, there is a portage to Ottertail Lake, the eastern source of Red
River. This is the common war road of the Mukundwa against
the Sioux.</p>

<p>On coming out of Lac Plè, freshwater shells began to show
themselves, chiefly species of naiades, a feature in the natural history
of this stream which is afterwards common; but I observed
none of much size, and they are often greatly decorticated. Four
or five miles lower, we entered Assowa Lake, and about a mile
and a half further, Lac Vieux Desert, or Old Gardon Lake, so
called from the remains of a trading station, where we halted for
breakfast. On resuming the descent, just twenty minutes were
required, with vigorous strokes of the paddle, to pass it. It has
an outlet about two miles long, when the stream again expands
into a lake of considerable size, which we called Summit Lake.
Thus far, we had been passing on a geological plateau of the
diluvial character, extending southwest. But from this point the
course of the river veers, at first towards the east and northeast,
and, after a wide circuit, to the southeast, and eventually again
to the southwest. From this point, rapids begin to mark its
channel. The river, consequently, assumes a velocity which,
while it hurries the traveller on, increases his danger of running
his frail bark against rocks or shoals. We had been driven down
this accelerated channel two hours and fifteen minutes, when it
expanded into a sheet called Long Rice Lake. This is some
three miles in length, and, at a very short distance below it, the
river again expands into a considerable lake, which, from the
circumstance of Lieut. Allen having circumnavigated it, I called
Allen's Lake. He found it the recipient of a small river from the
north. It is, apparently, the largest of this series of river lakes
below the Kaginogumaug. While crossing it, we experienced a
very severe and sudden tempest of wind and rain, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>by most severe and appalling peals of thunder and vivid lightning.
Broad ribbons of fire, in acute angles, appeared to rend
the skies. Before the shore could be reached, the tempest had
subsided, so sudden was its development. A short distance below
this, the river makes its tenth evolution, in the shape of a lake,
on which, as my Indian maps gave no name, I bestowed the name
of <i>Illigan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[183]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class="hanging indent">Complete the exploration of the Crow-Wing River of Minnesota&mdash;Indian council&mdash;Reach
St. Anthony's Falls&mdash;Council with the Sioux&mdash;Ascent and exploration of
the River St. Croix and Misakoda, or Broulé, of Lake Superior&mdash;Return of the
party to St. Mary's Falls, Michigan.</p>

<p>At Illigan Lake, large oaks and elms appear in the forest; its
banks are handsomely elevated, and the whole country puts on
the appearance of being well adapted to cultivation. We landed
to obtain a shot at some deer, which stood temptingly in sight, and
were impressed with the sylvan aspect of the country. While in
the act of passing out of the lake in our canoes, a small fire was
observed on shore, with the usual signs of its having been abandoned
in haste by Indians, who had been lying in ambush.
Every appearance seemed to justify such a conclusion, and it was
evident a party of Sioux had been concealed waiting the descent
of Chippewas, but, on observing our flag, and the public character
of the party, they hastily withdrew. Our men, knowing the perfidious
and cruel character of this tribe, were evidently a good deal
alarmed at these signs. We had been one hour in our canoes,
descending the river with the double force of current and paddles,
when the river was found again expanded, and for the eleventh
and last time, in a lake, which the natives call <i>Kaitchebo Sagatowa</i>,
meaning the lake through one end of which the river passes. As
this is not a term, however graphic, which will pass into popular
use, I named it Lake Douglas, in allusion to a former companion
in explorations in the northwest.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[184]</a> Ten miles below this lake,
the river receives its first considerable tributary in Shell River,
the Aisisepi of the Chippewas, which flows in from the right,
from the slope of the Hauteurs des Terres, near the Ottertail Lake.
Below this tributary, the Crow-Wing is nearly doubled in width,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>and there is no further fear of shallow water. We held on our
way for a distance of fourteen miles below the point of junction,
and encamped on the right hand bank at eight o'clock P.M.
It had rained copiously during the afternoon, and everything in
the shape of kindling stuff had become so completely saturated
with moisture, that it was quite an enterprise in the men to light
a camp-fire. Lieut. Allen did not reach our encampment this
night, having been misled in Allen's Lake, and, being driven
ashore by the tempest, he encamped in that quarter. Presuming
him to be in advance, I had pushed on, to a late hour, and
encamped under this impression.</p>

<p>The next morning (20th), we set off from our camp betimes,
and, having now a full flowing river, made good speed. The
river passes for a dozen or more miles through a willowy low
tract, on issuing from which there begins a series of strong rapids.
Twenty-four of these rapids were counted, which were called the
Metunna Rapids. Lieut. Allen estimates that they occupy thirty
miles of the channel of the river. Below these rapids, the river
extends to a mean width of three hundred feet. At this locality
we were overtaken by Mr. Allen, at about two o'clock in the
afternoon, and were thus first apprised of the fact that he had
been all the while in our rear instead of in front.</p>

<p>Twenty miles below the Metunna Rapids, Leaf River flows
in from the right, by a mouth of forty yards wide. This stream
originates in Leaf Lake, and is navigable sixty miles in the
largest craft used by the traders.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[185]</a> The volume of the Crow-Wing
River is constantly increased in width and velocity by these
accessions, which enabled us fearlessly to make a large day's
journey. We encamped together after sunset, on an elevated
pine bank, having descended ninety miles.</p>

<p>The 21st, we were early in motion, the river presenting a broad
rushing mass of waters, every way resembling the Mississippi
itself. On reaching within twenty miles of its mouth, we passed,
on the right bank, the mouth of the Long Prairie River,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[186]</a> a
prime tributary flowing from the great Ottertail slope, which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>been, time out of mind, the war road between the Chippewas and
Sioux; and between this point and the confluence coming in
we passed, on the left bank, the confluence of the Kioshk, or Gull
River, through which there is a communication, by a series of
portages, with Leech Lake.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[187]</a></p>

<p>From head to foot, we had now passed through the valley of
the De Corbeau River, without finding in it the permanent location
of a single Indian. We had not, in fact, seen even a temporary
wigwam upon its banks. The whole river lies, in fact, on the
war road between the two large rival tribes of the Chippewas and
Sioux. It is entered by war parties from either side, decked out
in war-paints and feathers, who descend either of its tributaries, the
Leaf and Long Prairie Rivers. The Mukundwa descends the
main channel from the Kaginogumaug Lake in canoes. On
reaching the field of ambush, these canoes are abandoned, and
the parties, after an encounter, haste home on foot.</p>

<p>From this deserted and uninhabited state of the valley we
were the more surprised, as noon drew on, to descry an Indian
canoe ascending the river. It proved to be spies on the look-out,
from the body of Chippewas encamped at the mouth of the river,
agreeably to my invitation at Sandy Lake. After mutual recognitions,
and learning that we were near the mouth of the river,
we resumed our descent with renewed spirit, and soon reached
its outflow into the Mississippi, and crossed it to the point at
which the Indians had established their camp. We were received
with yells of welcome. It occupied an eminence on the east
bank of the Mississippi, directly opposite to the mouth of the
De Corbeau.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[188]</a> The site was marked by a flag hoisted on a tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>staff. The Indians fired a salute as we landed, and pressed
down to the shore, with their chiefs, to greet us. They informed
me that by their count of sticks, of the time appointed by me
at Sandy Lake, to meet them at this spot, would be out this day,
and I had the satisfaction of being told, within a short time of
my arrival, that the canoe, with goods and supplies, from Sandy
Lake, was in sight. The Indians were found encamped a short
distance above the entrance of the Nokasippi<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[189]</a> River, which is in
the line of communication with the Mille Lac and Rum River
Indians. I found the latter, together with the whole Sandy Lake
Band, encamped here, awaiting my arrival. They numbered 280
souls, of whom 60 were warriors.</p>

<p>A council was immediately summoned, to meet in front of my
tent, at the appointed signal of the firing of the military; the
business of my mission was at once explained, the presents distributed,
and the vaccinations commenced. Replies were made
at length, by the eldest chief, Gros Guelle, or Big Snout; by
Soangekumig, or the Strong Echoing Ground; by Wabogeeg, or
the White Fisher; and by Nitumegaubowee, or the First Standing
Man. The business having been satisfactorily concluded, the
vaccination finished, and having still a couple of hours of daylight,
I embarked and went down the Mississippi some ten or fifteen
miles, to a Mr. Baker's trading-house at Prairie Piercie.</p>

<p>At this place, I remained encamped, it being the Sabbath day,
and rested on the 22d, which had a good effect on the whole
party, engaged as it had been, night and day, in pushing its way
to accomplish certain results, and it prepared them to spring to
their paddles the more cheerfully on Monday morning. Indeed,
it had been part of my plan of travel, from the outset, to give
the men this rest and opportunity to recruit every seventh day,
and I always found that they did more work in the long run,
from it. I had also engaged them, originally, not to drink any
ardent spirits, promising them, however, that their board and pot
should be well supplied at all times. And, indeed, although I
had frequently travelled with Canadian canoemen, I never knew
a crew who worked so cheerfully, and travelled so far, per diem,
on the mean of the week, as these six days' working canoemen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p>At Mr. Baker's, 170 miles above St. Anthony's Falls, I found a
stray number of a small newspaper, and first learned the state of
the Sauc and Fox war. The chief, Blackhawk, had crossed the
Mississippi, to enter the Rock River valley; had murdered Mr. St.
Vrain, the United States agent, sustained a conflict with the Illinois
militia, under Major Stillman, fled to Lake Gushkenong, on
the head of Rock River, and drawn upon his movement the
United States army, leaving, at last accounts, Generals Atkinson
and Dodge in pursuit of him.</p>

<p>Having struck the Mississippi at the point where the prior
narrative describes it (<i>vide</i> Chap XII.), it becomes unnecessary
to give details of my descent to St. Anthony's Falls. Leaving
Prairie Piercie on the 23d, two days were employed in the descent
to Fort Snelling. I found Captain Wm. R. Jouett in command,
who received me with courtesy and kindness, and offered every
facility, in the absence of Mr. Talliaferro, the United States Indian
Agent, for laying the object of my mission before the Sioux. He
had received no very recent intelligence of the progress of the
Sauc war, in addition to that which I had learned at the mouth of
the De Corbeau; although he was in the habit of sending a mail
boat or canoe twice a month to Prairie du Chien.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[190]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th, being the day after my arrival, I met the assembled,
Sioux, in council, at the Agency House, the commanding officer
being present, and having finished that business, and finding the
Sioux wholly unconnected with, and disapproving the proceedings
of Blackhawk and his adherents, I embarked early the next
morning on my return to Lake Superior. I reached the mouth of
the River St. Croix, at three o'clock P. M. on the 26th, and having
entered the sylvan sheet of Lake St. Croix, ascended it to within a
few miles of its head, and encamped. Lieut. Allen did not reach
my camp, but halted for the night some seven or eight miles short.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[191]</a>
This lake is one of the most beautiful and picturesque sheets of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>water in the West, being from two to three miles wide, and some
four-and-twenty or thirty in length.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[192]</a> The next morning I reached
the head of the lake after a couple of hours of travel, and, by a
diligent and hard day's work, during which we passed between
perpendicular walls of sonorous trap-rock, reached and encamped
at the falls of St. Croix, at eight o'clock in the evening.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[193]</a> We
were now about fifty miles from the line of the Mississippi River.
For the last few miles, there had been either a very strong current
or severe eddies of water, around angular masses of trap-rock;
and we were encamped at the precise foot of the falls, where the
river, narrowed to some fifty feet, breaks its way through trap-rock,
falling some fifty feet in the course of six hundred yards. We
had been carried, at a tangent, from the great Mississippi series
of the silurian period, beginning at St. Anthony's Falls, to the
vitric formations of trap and greenstone of the Lake Superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>system, and were now to ascend a valley, in which a heavy diluvial
drift and boulder stratum rested on this broken and angular
basis.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[194]</a> On reaching the summit of the St. Croix, there are found
vast plateaux of sand, supporting pine forests; and on descending
the Misakoda, or Brulé of Fond du Lac, the sandstone strata of that
basin are again encountered. This ascent was rendered arduous,
from the low state of the water. I reached Snake River on the
30th, had an interview with the Buffalo chief (Pezhikee) and his
subordinates; finding the population 300, with thirty-eight half
breeds. The men, while here, cut their feet, treading on the trap-rock
debris, in the mouth of the river. The distance thence to
Yellow River is about thirty-five miles, which we accomplished
on the 31st, by eight o'clock in the morning, having found our
greatest obstacle at the Kettle Rapids, which discloses sharp
masses of the trap-rock. The river, in this distance, receives on
its right, in the ascent, the Aisippi, or Shell River, which originates
in a lake of that name, noted for its large unios and anadontas.</p>

<p>At Yellow River, I halted to confer with the Indians in front
of a remarkable eminence called Pokunogun, or the Moose's Hip.
This eminence is not, however, of artificial construction. This
river, with its dependencies of Lac Vaseux, Rice Lake, and Yellow
Lake, contains a Chippewa population of three hundred and
eighty-two souls. We observed here the unio purpureus, which
the Indians use for spoons, after rubbing off the alatæ and rounding
the margin. We also examined the skin of the sciurus tredacem
striatus of Mitchill.</p>

<p>We reached the forks of the St. Croix about two o'clock P. M.
The distance from Yellow River is about thirteen miles; it required
five and a half hours to accomplish this. The water was,
indeed, so low, that the men had often to wade; and, on reaching
this point, we were to lose half its volume, or more, for the
Namakagun<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[195]</a> fork, which enters here, carries in more than half
the quantity of water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>I found the chief Kabamappa and his followers encamped at
the forks, awaiting my arrival, who received me with a salute.
He disclaimed all connection with the movement of the Blackhawk.
He stated facts, however, which showed him to be well
acquainted with the means which that chief had used to bring
the Indians into an extensive league against the United States.
He readily assented to the measures proposed to the upper bands,
for bringing the Sioux and Chippewas into more intimate and
permanent relations of peace and friendship.</p>

<p>With respect to the ascent of the St. Croix, in the direction of
the Brulé, his exclamation was <i>iskutta-iskutta</i>, meaning it is
dried up, or there is no water. Dry the channel, indeed, looked,
but by leading the canoes around the shoals, all the men walking
in the water, and picking out channels, we advanced about seven
miles before the time of encampment. The next morning (Aug. 1)
a heavy fog detained us in our encampment, till five o'clock,
when we recommenced the ascent of a similar series of embarrassments
from very low water, rapid succeeding to rapid, till two
o'clock P. M., when we reached the summit of a plateau, and
found still water and comparatively good navigation. Five hours
canoeing on this summit brought us to Kabamappa's village at
the Namakowágon, or sturgeon's dam, where we encamped. The
chief gave us his population at 88 souls, of whom 28 were men,
including the minor chief, Mukudapenas,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[196]</a> and his men. We
had now got above all the strong rapids, and proceeded from our
encampment at four o'clock, A. M., on the 2d. The river receives
two tributaries, from the right hand, on this summit, namely, the
Buffalo and Clearwater, and, at the distance of about ten miles
above the Namakowágon, is found to be expanded in a handsome
lake of about six miles in extent, called Lake St. Croix. This is
the source of the river. We were favored with a fair wind in
passing over it, and having reached its head debarked on a
marshy margin, and immediately commenced the portage to the
Brulé, or Misakoda River.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[197]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
I had now reached the summit between the St. Croix and Lake
Superior. The elevation of this summit has not been scientifically
determined; but from the great fall of the Brulé, cannot be less
than 600 feet. The length of the Brulé is about 100 miles, in
which there are 240 distinct rapids. Some of these are from eight
to ten feet each. Four of them require portages, at which all the
canoes are discharged. The river itself, on looking down it, appears
to be a perfect torrent, foaming and roaring; and it could
never be used by the traders at all, were it not that it had abundance
of water, being the off-drain for an extensive plateau of lakes
and springs. To give an adequate idea of this foaming torrent,
it is necessary to conceive of a river flowing down a pair of stairs,
a hundred miles long.</p>

<p>The portage from the St. Croix to it begins on marsh, ascending
in a hundred yards or so, to an elevated sandy plain, which
has been covered, at former times, with a heavy forest of the
pinus resinosa; that having been consumed, there is left here and
there a dry trunk, or <i>auk</i>, as the Indians call it. The length of
the portage path is 3,350 yards, or about two miles. At this distance,
we reach a small, sandy-bottomed brook, of four feet wide
and a foot deep, of most clear crystalline cold water, winding its
way, in a most serpentine manner, through a boggy tract, and
overhung with dense alder bushes. It is a good place to slake
one's thirst, but appears like anything else than a stream to
embark on, with canoes and baggage. Nobody but an Indian
would seem to have ever dreamed of it. Yet on this brook we
embarked. It was now six o'clock in the evening. By going a
distance below, and damming up the stream, a sufficient depth of
water was got to float the canoes. The axe was used to cut away
the alders. The men walked, guiding the canoes, and carrying
some of the baggage. In this way we moved slowly, about one
mile, when it became quite dark, and threatened rain. The voyageurs
then searched about for a place on the bog dry enough to
sleep on, and came, with joy, and told me that they had found a
kind of bog, with bunches of grassy tufts, which are called by
them <i>tete de femme</i>. The very poetry of the idea was something,
and I was really happy, amid the intense gloom, to rest my head,
for the night, on these fair tufts. The next morning we were
astir as soon as there was light enough to direct our steps. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
a few miles of these intricacies, we found a brisk and full tributary,
below which, the descent is at once free, and on crossing the
first narrow geologic plateau, the rapids begin; the stream being
constantly and often suddenly enlarged, by springs and tributaries
from the right and left. To describe the descent of this
stream, in detail, would require graphic powers to which I do not
aspire, and time which I cannot command. We were two days
and a part of a night in making the descent, with every appliance
of voyageur craft. It was after darkness had cast her pall over
us, on the evening of the 4th of August, before we reached still
water. The river is then a deep and broad mass of water, into
which coasting vessels from the Lake might enter. Some four
miles from the foot of the last rapids, it enters the Fond du Lac
of Lake Superior. Some time before reaching this point, we had
been apprised of our contiguity to it, from hearing the monotonous
thump of the Indian drum; and we were glad, on our arrival,
to find the chief, Mongazid,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[198]</a> of Fond du Lac, with the military
barge of Lieut. Allen, left at that place on our outward trip,
which he had promised to bring down to this point.</p>

<p>Having thus accomplished the objects committed to my trust,
and rejoined the track described in my prior narrative, I rested
here on the next day (5th), being the Sabbath; and then proceeded
through Lake Superior, to my starting-point at Sault de
Ste Marie.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[199]</a></p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>1. DEPARTMENTAL REPORTS.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, September 14, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> I am happy to be enabled to state to you that I reached
this place four days since, with some of the gentlemen who accompanied
me on my late tour, after a very fortunate journey of four
thousand miles, and an accomplishment, without any adverse
accident, of every object intrusted to me. The party divided at
Green Bay, with a view to circumnavigate Lake Michigan, and I
trust they may all arrive here in the course of a week.</p>

<p>As soon as possible, I shall transmit to you a detailed report
upon the subject.</p>

<p>Since my arrival, I have learned that Mr. Ellicott, professor of
mathematics, at the military academy, is dead. I cannot but hope
that the office will not be filled until the return of Captain Douglass.
I do not know whether such an appointment would suit
him; but from my knowledge of his views, feelings, and pursuits,
I presume it would. And an intimate acquaintance with him
during my tour enables me to say that in every requisite qualification,
as far as I can judge, I have never found a man who is his
superior. His zeal, talents, and acquirements are of the first
order, and I am much deceived if he do not soon take a distinguished
rank among the most scientific men in our country. His
situation as an assistant professor to Colonel Mansfield, and his
connection with the family of Mr. Ellicott, furnish additional
reasons why he should receive this appointment.</p>

<p class="signature">
Very respectfully, sir,<br />
<span class="i1">I have the honor to be</span><br />
<span class="i2">Your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="i4">LEWIS CASS.</span></p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">J. C. Calhoun</span>, <i>Secretary of War</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, October 21, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> I had the honor to inform you some time since that I
had reached this place by land from Chicago, and that the residue
of the party were daily expected. They arrived soon after, without
accident, and this long and arduous journey has been accomplished
without the occurrence of any unfavorable incident.</p>

<p>I shall submit to you, as soon as it can be prepared, a memoir
respecting the Indians who occupy the country through which
we passed; their numbers, disposition, wants, &amp;c. It will be
enough at present to say, that the whole frontier is in a state of
profound peace, and that the remote Indians, more particularly,
exhibit the most friendly feelings towards the United States. As
we approach the points of contact between them and the British,
the strength of this attachment evidently decreases, and about
those points few traces of it remain. During our whole progress
but two incidents occurred which evinced in the slightest degree,
an unfriendly spirit. One of these was at St. Mary's, within
forty-five miles of Drummond's Island, and the other within thirty
miles of Malden. They passed off, however, without producing
any serious result.</p>

<p>It is due to Colonel Leavenworth to say, that his measures
upon the subject of the outrage committed by the Winnebago
Indians, in the spring, were prompt, wise, and decisive. As you
have long since learned, the murderers were soon surrendered;
and so impressive has been the lesson upon the minds of the
Indians, that the transaction has left us nothing to regret, but the
untimely fall of the soldiers.</p>

<p>In my passage through the Winnebago country, I saw their
principal chiefs, and stated to them the necessity of restraining
their young men from the commission of acts similar in their
character to those respecting which a report was made by Colonel
Smith. I have reason to believe that similar complaints will not
again be made, and I am certain that nothing but the intemperate
passions of individuals will lead to the same conduct. Should it
occur, the act will be disavowed by the chiefs, and the offenders
surrendered with as much promptitude as the relapsed state of
the government will permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
The general route which we pursued was from this place to
Michilimackinac by the southern shore of Lake Huron. From
thence to Drummond's Island and by the River St. Mary's to
the Sault. We there entered Lake Superior, coasted its southern
shore to Point Kewena, ascended the small stream, which forms
the water communication across the base of the point, and, after
a portage of a mile and a half, struck the lake on the opposite
side. Fifty miles from this place is the mouth of the Ontonagan,
upon which have been found large specimens of copper.</p>

<p>We ascended that stream about thirty miles, to the great mass
of that metal, whose existence has long been known. Common
report has greatly magnified the quantity, although enough remains,
even after a rigid examination, to render it a mineralogical
curiosity. Instead of being a mass of pure copper, it is rather
copper imbedded in a hard rock, and the weight does not probably
exceed five tons, of which the rock is the much larger part. It was
impossible to procure any specimens, for such was its hardness
that our chisels broke like glass. I intend to send some Indians
in the spring to procure the necessary specimens. As we understand
the nature of the substance, we can now furnish them with
such tools as will effect the object. I shall, on their return, send
you such pieces as you may wish to retain for the Government,
or to distribute as cabinet specimens to the various literary institutions
of our country. Mr. Schoolcraft will make to you a
detailed report upon this subject, in particular, and generally
upon the various mineralogical and geological objects to which
his inquiries were directed. Should he carry into effect the
intention, which he now meditates, of publishing his journal of
the tour, enriched with the history of the facts which have been
collected, and with those scientific and practical reflections and
observations, which few men are more competent to make, his
work will rank among the most important accessions which have
ever been made to our national literature.</p>

<p>From the Ontonagon we proceeded to the Fond du Lac, passing
the mouths of the Montreal, Mauvais, and Brulé Rivers, and entered
the mouth of the St. Louis, or Fond du Lac River, which
forms the most considerable water communication between Lake
Superior and the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The southern coast of the lake is sterile, cold, and unpromising.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
The timber is birch, pine, and trees of that description
which characterize the nature of the country. The first part of
the shore is moderately elevated, the next, hilly, and even mountainous,
and the last a low, flat, sandy beach. Two of the most
sublime natural objects in the United States, the Grand Sable and
the pictured rocks, are to be found upon this coast. The former
is an immense hill of sand, extending for some miles along the
lake, of great elevation and precipitous ascent. The latter is an
unbroken wall of rocks, rising perpendicularly from the lake to
the height of 300 feet, assuming every grotesque and fanciful
appearance, and presenting to the eye of the passenger a spectacle
as tremendous as the imagination can conceive, or as reason itself
can well sustain.</p>

<p>The emotions excited by these objects are fresh in the recollection
of us all; and they will undoubtedly be described, so that
the public can appreciate their character and appearance. The
indications of copper upon the western part of the coast, are
numerous; and there is reason to suppose that silver, in small
quantities, has been found.</p>

<p>The communication by the Montreal with the Chippewa River,
and by the Mauvais and Brulé Rivers with the St. Croix, is
difficult and precarious. The routes are interrupted by long,
numerous, and tedious portages, across which the boats and all
their contents are transported by the men. It is doubtful whether
their communication can ever be much used, except for the
purposes to which they are now applied. In the present state of
the Indian trade, human labor is nothing, because the number of
men employed in transporting the property is necessary to conduct
the trade, after the different parties have reached their destination,
and the intermediate labor does not affect the aggregate
amount of the expense. Under ordinary circumstances, and for
those purposes to which water communication is applied in the
common course of civilized trade, these routes would be abandoned.
From the mouth of the Montreal River alone to its source,
there are not less than forty-five miles of portage.</p>

<p>The St. Louis River is a considerable stream, and for twenty-five
miles its navigation is uninterrupted. At this distance, near
an establishment of the Southwest Company, commences the
Grand Portage about six miles in length, across spurs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Porcupine ridge of mountains. One other portage, one of a mile
and a half, and a continued succession of falls, called the Grand
Rapids, extending nine miles, and certainly unsurmountable except
by the skill and perseverance of the Canadian boatmen, conduct
us to a comparatively tranquil part of the river. From here to
the head of the Savannah River, a small branch of the St. Louis,
the navigation is uninterrupted, and after a portage of four miles,
the descent is easy into Lake au Sable, whose outlet is within
two miles of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>This was until 1816 the principal establishment of the British
Northwest Company upon these waters, and is now applied to
the same purpose by the American Fur Company.</p>

<p>From Lac au Sable, we ascended the Mississippi to the Upper
Red Cedar Lake, which may be considered as the head of the
navigation of that river. The whole distance, 350 miles, is almost
uninhabitable. The first part of the route the country is generally
somewhat elevated and interspersed with pine woods. The
latter part is level wet prairie.</p>

<p>The sources of this river flow from a region filled with lakes
and swamps, whose geological character indicates a recent formation,
and which, although the highest table-land of this part of the
Continent, is yet a dead level, presenting to the eye a succession
of dreary uninteresting objects. Interminable marshes, numerous
ponds, and a few low, naked, sterile plains, with a small stream,
not exceeding sixty feet in width, meandering in a very crooked
channel through them, are all the objects which are found to reward
the traveller for the privations and difficulties which he
must encounter in his ascent to this forbidding region.</p>

<p>The view on all sides is dull and monotonous. Scarcely a living
being animates the prospect, and every circumstance recalled
forcibly to our recollection that we were far removed from civilized
life.</p>

<p>From Lac au Sable to the mouth of the St. Peter's, the distance
by computation is six hundred miles. The first two hundred
present no obstacles to navigation. The land along the river is
of a better quality than above; the bottoms are more numerous,
and the timber indicates a stronger and more productive soil.
But near this point commence the great rapids of the Mississippi,
which extend more than two hundred miles. The river flows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
over a rocky bed, which forms a continuous succession of rapids,
all of which are difficult and some dangerous. The country, too,
begins here to open, and the immense plains in which the buffaloes
range approach the river. These plains continue to the
Falls of St. Anthony.</p>

<p>They are elevated fifty or sixty feet above the Mississippi, are
destitute of timber, and present to the eye a flat, uniform surface,
bounded at the distance of eight or ten miles by high ground.
The title of this land is in dispute between the Chippewas and
Sioux, and their long hostilities have prevented either party from
destroying the game in a manner as improvident as is customary
among the Indians. It is consequently more abundant than in
any other region through which we travelled.</p>

<p>From the post, at the mouth of the St. Peter's, to Prairie du
Chien, and from that place to Green Bay, the route is too well-known
to render it necessary that I should trouble you with any
observations respecting it.</p>

<p>The whole distance travelled by the party between the 24th of
May and the 24th of September exceeded 4,200 miles, and the
journey was performed without the occurrence of a single untoward
accident sufficiently important to deserve recollection.</p>

<p>These notices are so short and imperfect that I am unwilling to
obtrude them upon your patience. But the demands upon your
attention are so imperious, that to swell them into a geographical
memoir would require more time for their examination than any
interest which I am capable of giving the subject would justify.</p>

<p>I propose hereafter to submit some other observations to you
in a different shape.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Copy of a letter from Gov. Lewis Cass to Hon. John C. Calhoun,
Secretary of War, dated</p>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, September 20, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> In examining the state of our topographical knowledge,
respecting that portion of the Northwestern frontier over which
we have recently passed, it occurs to me that there are several
points which require further examination, and which might be
explored without any additional expense to the United States.</p>

<p>The general result of the observations made by Capt. Douglass,
will be submitted to you as soon as it can be prepared. And I
believe he will also complete a map of the extensive route we
have taken, and embracing the whole of the United States,
bounded by the Upper Lakes and by the waters of the Mississippi,
and extending as far south as Rock Island and the southern extremities
of Lakes Michigan and Erie. The materials in his possession
are sufficient for such an outline, and he is every way
competent to complete it. But there are several important
streams, respecting which it is desirable to procure more accurate
information than can be obtained from the vague and contradictory
relations of Indians and Indian traders. The progress of
our geographical knowledge has not kept pace with the extension
of our territory, nor with the enterprise of our traders. But I
trust the accurate observations of Captain Douglass will render a
resort to the old French maps for information respecting our own
country entirely unnecessary.</p>

<p>I beg leave to propose to you, whether it would not be proper
to direct exploring parties to proceed from several of our frontier
posts into the interior of the country, and to make such observations
as might lead to a correct topographical delineation of it.
An intelligent officer, with eight or ten men, in a canoe, would
be adequate to this object. He would require nothing more than
a compass to ascertain his course, for it is not to be expected that
correct astronomical observations could be taken. In ascending
or descending streams, he should enter in a journal every course
which he pursues, and the length of time observed by a watch.
He should occasionally ascertain the velocity of his canoe, by
measuring a short distance upon the bank, and should also enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in his journal his supposed rate of travelling. This, whenever it
is possible, should be checked by the distance as estimated by
traders and travellers. By a comparison of these data, and by a
little experience, he would soon be enabled to ascertain with
sufficient precision, the length of each course, and to furnish
materials for combination, which would eventually exhibit a perfect
view of the country. I do not know any additional expense
which it would be necessary to encounter. An ordinary compass
is not worth taking into consideration. A necessary supply of
provisions, a small quantity of powder, lead, and tobacco, to present
occasionally to the Indians, and a little medicine, are all the
articles which would require particular attention. Officers
employed upon such services should be directed to observe the
natural appearances of the country; its soil, timber, and productions;
its general face and character; the height, direction, and
composition of its hills; the number, size, rapidity, &amp;c., of its
streams; its geological structure and mineralogical products; and
any facts which may enable the public to appreciate its importance
in the scale of territorial acquisitions, or which may serve
to enlarge the sphere of national science.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that officers detached upon the duties
can enter into the detail of such subjects in a manner which their
importance would render desirable. But the most superficial
observer may add something to the general stock; and to point
their inquiries to specific objects, may be the means of eliciting
facts, which in other hands may lead to important results. The
most important tributary stream of the Upper Mississippi is the
Saint Peter's. The commanding officer at the mouth of that river
might be directed to form an expedition for exploring it.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of Captain Douglass, and it is strongly fortified
by my personal observation, and by the opinion of others,
that Lieut. Talcott, of the Engineers, now at the Council Bluffs,
would conduct a party upon this duty in a very satisfactory
manner. He might ascend the St. Peter's to its source, and from
thence cross over to the Red River, and descend the stream to
the 49th parallel of latitude, with directions to take the necessary
observations upon so important a point.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[200]</a> Thence up that branch
of the Red River, interlocking with the nearest water of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>Mississippi, and down this river to Leech Lake. From this lake,
there is an easy communication to the River de Corbeau, which
he could descend to the Mississippi, and thence to St. Peter's.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[201]</a></p>

<p>The St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers, entering the Mississippi
above and below the Falls of St. Anthony, might, in like manner,
be explored by parties from the same post.[A] The former interlocks
with the Mauvais and Brulé Rivers, but a descent into Lake Superior
would not probably be considered expedient, so that the
party would necessarily ascend and descend the same stream.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[202]</a></p>

<p>The Chippewa interlocks with the Montreal and Wisconsin
Rivers, and consequently the same party could ascend the former
and descend the latter stream.</p>

<p>A party from Green Bay might explore Rocky River from its
source to its mouth.</p>

<p>A correct examination of Green Bay and of the Menomonie
River might be made from the same post.</p>

<p>The St. Joseph and Grand River, of this peninsula, could be
examined by parties detached from Chicago.</p>

<p>It is desirable, also, to explore the Grand Traverse Bay, about
sixty miles south of Michilimackinac, on the east coast of Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p>These are all the points which require particular examination.
Observations made in the manner I have suggested, and connected
with those already taken by Captain Douglass, would furnish
ample materials for a correct chart of the country.</p>

<p>It is with this view that it might be proper, should you approve
the plan I have submitted to you, to direct, that the reports of
the officers should be transmitted to Captain Douglass, by whom
they will be incorporated with his own observations, and will
appear in a form best calculated to promote the views which you
entertain upon the important subject of the internal geography
of our country.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, October 3, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> On the eve of separating from my associates in our late
tour, I owe it to them and to myself, that I should state to you
my opinion respecting Captain Douglass and Mr. Schoolcraft.</p>

<p>I have found them, upon every occasion, zealous in promoting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>the objects of the Expedition, indefatigable in their inquiries and
observations, and never withholding their personal exertions.
Ardent in their pursuit after knowledge, with great attainments
in the departments of literature to which they have respectively
devoted themselves, and with powers which will enable them to
explore the whole field of science, I look forward with confidence
to the day when they will assume distinguished stations
among our scientific men, and powerfully aid in establishing the
literary fame of their country.</p>

<p>Should any object of a similar character again require similar
talents, I earnestly recommend their employment. Whoever has
the pleasure of being associated with them, will find how easily
profound acquirements may be united with that urbanity of
manners, and those qualities of the heart, which attach to each
other those who have participated in the fatigues of a long and
interesting tour.</p>

<h3>2. TOPOGRAPHY AND ASTRONOMY.</h3>

<p>Topographical materials were collected by Capt. Douglass, U.S.A.,
for a map of the northwestern portions of the United States,
embracing the complete circumnavigation of the great lake basins,
and accurate delineations of the sources of the Mississippi, as low
down as the influx of the River Wisconsin. Being provided with
instruments from the Military Academy of West Point, astronomical
observations were made at every practical point over the
vast panorama traversed by the Expedition. A line of some four
thousand miles of previously unexplored country was visited;
his notes and memoranda for a topographical memoir were full
and exact; and they were left, I am informed, in a state of nearly
perfect elaboration, accompanied by illustrations, and many drawings
of scenery. Having written to his family recently, for the
astronomical observations, they were transmitted by his son in a
letter, of which the following is an extract:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Geneva,</span> June 23, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span> I inclose you herewith, on another page, the results
of my father's observations of latitude and longitude, so far as I
have been able to collect them. His calculations indicate great
pains and labor to obtain accurate results. They are too voluminous
to copy. I trust, however, that I have been as particular
as was necessary in the inclosed memoranda. If anything else is
wanting, I should like you to inform me.</p>

<h3>3. MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY.</h3>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Report on the Copper Mines of Lake Superior.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry R.
Schoolcraft</span>.</p>

<p>To the Hon. <span class="smcap">John C. Calhoun</span>, <i>Secretary of War</i>.</p>
<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Vernon</span> (Oneida County, N. Y.), November 6, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> I have now the honor to submit such observations as
have occurred to me, during the recent expedition under GOV.
Cass, in relation to the copper mines on Lake Superior; reserving,
as the subject of a future communication, the facts I have
collected on the mineralogy and geology of the country explored
generally.</p>

<p>The first striking change in the mineral aspect of the country
north of Lake Huron, is presented near the head of the Island of
St. Joseph, in the River St. Mary, where the calcareous strata of
secondary rocks are succeeded by a formation of red sandstone,
which extends northward to the head of that river at Point Iroquois,
producing the falls called the <i>Sault de Ste. Marie</i>, fifteen
miles below; and thence stretching northwest, along the whole
southern shore of Lake Superior, with the interruptions noted, to
Fond du Lac.</p>

<p>This extensive stratum is perforated at various points by upheaved
masses of sienitic granite and trap, which appear in elevated
points on the margin of the lake at Dead River, Keweena
Point, Presque Isle, and the Chegoimagon Mountains. It is
overlaid, in other parts, by a stratum of gray or neutral-colored
sandstone, of uncommon thickness, which appears in various
promontories along the shore, and, at the distance of ninety miles
from Point Iroquois, constitutes a lofty perpendicular and caverned
wall, upon the water's edge, called the Pictured Rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
So obvious a change in the geological character of the rock
strata, in passing from Lake Huron to Lake Superior, prepares
the observer to expect a corresponding one in the imbedded
minerals and other natural features&mdash;an expectation which is
realized during the first eighty leagues, in the discovery of various
minerals. The first appearances of copper are seen at Keweena
Point, two hundred and seventy miles beyond the Sault de
Ste. Marie, where the debris and pebbles along the shore of the
lake contain native copper disseminated in particles varying in size
from a grain of sand to a mass of two pounds' weight. Many of
the detached stones of this Point are also colored green by the
carbonate of copper, and the rock strata exhibit traces of the
same ore. These indications continue to the River Ontonagon,
which has long been noted for the large masses of native copper
found upon its banks, and about the contiguous country.</p>

<p>This river is one of the largest of thirty tributaries, mostly
small, which flow into the lake between Point Iroquois and Fond
du Lac. It originates in a district of mountainous country intermediate
between the Mississippi River and lakes Huron and
Superior. After running in a northern direction for about one
hundred and twenty miles, it enters the latter at the computed
distance of fifty miles west of the portage of Keweena, in north
latitude 46° 52´ 2´´, according to the observations of Capt. Douglass.
It is connected, by portages, with the Monomonee River
of Green Bay, and with the Chippewa River of the Mississippi.
At its mouth there is a village of Chippewa Indians of sixteen
families, who subsist chiefly on the fish taken in the river. Their
location, independent of that circumstance, does not appear to
unite the ordinary advantages of an Indian village of the region.</p>

<p>A strip of alluvial land of a sandy character extends from the
lake up the river three or four leagues, where it is succeeded by
hills of a broken, sterile aspect, covered, chiefly, with a growth
of pine, hemlock, and spruce. Among these hills, which may be
considered as lateral spurs of the Porcupine Mountains, the copper
mines, so called, are situated, at the computed distance of
thirty-two miles from the lake, and in the centre of a region characterized
by its wild, rugged, and forbidding appearance. The
large mass of native copper lies on the west bank of the river,
at the water's edge, at the foot of an elevated bank, part of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
appears to have slipped into the river, carrying with it the mass
of copper, together with detached blocks of sienitic granite, trap-rock,
and other species common to the soil at that place.</p>

<p>The copper, which is in a pure and malleable state, lies in connection
with serpentine rock, one face of which it almost completely
overlays. It is also disseminated in masses and grains
throughout the substance of the rock. The surface of the metal,
unlike most oxidable metals which have been long exposed to
the atmosphere, presents a metallic brilliancy, which is probably
attributable to the attrition of the semi-annual floods of the river.</p>

<p>The shape of the rock is very irregular; its greatest length is
three feet eight inches; its greatest breadth, three feet four inches,
with an average thickness of twelve inches. It may, altogether,
contain eleven cubic feet.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[207]</a> It exceeds, in size, the great mass of
native iron found some years ago on the banks of Red River, in
Louisiana. I have computed the weight of metallic copper in
the rock at twenty-two hundred pounds, which is about one-fifth
of the lowest estimate made of it by former visitors. Henry,
who visited it in 1766, estimated its weight at five tons. The
quantity may, however, have been much diminished since its discovery,
and the marks of chisels and axes upon it, with the discovery
of broken tools, prove that portions have been cut off and
carried away. Notwithstanding this reduction, it may still be
considered one of the largest and most remarkable bodies of native
copper on the globe, and is, so far as known, only exceeded
in weight by a specimen found in a valley in Brazil, weighing
twenty-six hundred and sixty-six Portuguese pounds. Viewed
as a subject of scientific interest, it presents illustrative proofs of
an important character. Its connection with a rock which is
foreign to the immediate section of country where it lies,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[208]</a> indicates
a removal from its original bed; while the intimate connection
of the metal and matrix, and the complete envelopment
of masses of the copper by the rock, point to a common and contemporaneous
origin, whether that be referable to volcanic agency
or water. This conclusion admits of an obvious application to
the beds of serpentine and other magnesian rock found in other
parts of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Several other large masses of native copper have been found,
either on this river or within the basin of the lake, at various
periods since the country has been known, and taken into different
parts of the United States and of Europe. A recent analysis of
one of these specimens, at the University of Leyden, proves it to
be native copper in a state of uncommon purity, and uncombined
with any notable portion of either gold or silver.</p>

<p>A mass of copper, weighing twenty-eight pounds, was discovered
on an island in Lake Superior, eighty miles west of the
Ontonagon. It was taken to Michilimackinac and disposed of.
The War Department was formerly supplied with a specimen
from this mass, and the analysis above alluded to is also understood
to have been made from a portion of it. A piece weighing
twelve pounds was found at Winnebago Lake. Other discoveries
of this metal have been made, within the region, at various times
and places.</p>

<p>The existence of copper in the region of Lake Superior appears
to have been known to the earliest travellers and voyagers.</p>

<p>As early as 1689, the Baron La Hontan, in concluding a description
of Lake Superior, adds: "That, upon it, we also find
copper mines, the metal of which is so fine and plentiful that
there is not a seventh part lost from the ore."&mdash;<i>New Voyages to
North America</i>, London, 1703.</p>

<p>In 1721, Charlevoix passed through the lakes on his way to
the Gulf of Mexico, and did not allow the mineralogy of the
country to escape him.</p>

<p>"Large pieces of copper are found in some places on its banks
[Lake Superior], and around some of the islands, which are still
the objects of a superstitious worship among the Indians. They
look upon them with veneration, as if they were the presents of
those gods who dwell under the waters. They collect their
smallest fragments, which they carefully preserve, without, however,
making any use of them. They say that formerly a huge
rock of this metal was to be seen elevated a considerable height
above the surface of the water, and, as it has now disappeared,
they pretend that the gods have carried it elsewhere; but there
is great reason to believe that, in process of time, the waves of
the lake have covered it entirely with sand and slime. And it is
certain that in several places pretty large quantities of this metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
have been discovered without being obliged to dig very deep.
During the course of my first voyage to this country, I was acquainted
with one of our order (Jesuits) who had been formerly
a goldsmith, and who, while he was at the mission of Sault de
Ste. Marie used to search for this metal, and made candlesticks,
crosses, and censers of it, for this copper is often to be met with
almost entirely pure."&mdash;<i>Journal of a Voyage to North America.</i></p>

<p>In 1766, Captain Carver procured several pieces of native copper
on the shores of Lake Superior, or on the Chippewa and St.
Croix Rivers, which are noticed in his travels, without much precision,
however, as to locality, &amp;c. He did not visit the southern
shores of Lake Superior, east of the entrance of the Brulé, or
Goddard's River, but states that virgin copper is found on the
Ontonagon. Of the north and northeastern shores, he remarks:
"That he observed that many of the small islands were covered
with copper <i>ore</i>, which appeared like beds of copperas, of which
many tons lay in a small space."&mdash;<i>Three Years' Travels, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In 1771 (four years before the breaking out of the American
Revolution), a considerable body of native copper was dug out
of the alluvial earth on the banks of the Ontonagon River by two
adventurers, of the names of Henry and Bostwick, and, together
with a lump of silver ore of eight pounds' weight, it was transported
to Montreal, and from thence shipped to England, where
the silver ore was deposited in the British Museum, after an
analysis had been made of a portion of it, by which it was determined
to contain 60 per cent. of silver.</p>

<p>These individuals were members of a company which had been
formed in England for the purpose of working the copper mines
of Lake Superior. The Duke of Gloucester, Sir William Johnson,
and other gentlemen of rank were members of this company.
They built a vessel at Point aux Pins, six miles above
the Sault Ste. Marie, to facilitate their operations on the lake. A
considerable sum of money was expended in explorations and
digging. Isle Maripeau and the Ontonagon were the principal
scenes of their search. They found silver, in a detached form, at
Point Iroquois, fifteen miles above the present site of Fort Brady.</p>

<p>"Hence," observes Henry, "we coasted westward, but found
nothing till we reached the Ontonagon, where, besides the detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
masses of copper formerly mentioned, <i>we saw much of the same
metal imbedded in stone</i>.</p>

<p>"Proposing to ourselves to make a trial on the hill, till we were
better able to go to work upon the solid rock, we built a house, and
sent to the Sault de Ste. Marie for provisions. At the spot pitched
upon for the commencement of our operations, a green-colored
water, which tinges iron of a copper color, issued from the hill,
and this the miners called a <i>leader</i>. In digging, they found frequent
masses of copper, some of which were of three pounds'
weight. Having arranged everything for the accommodation of
the miners during the winter, we returned to the Sault.</p>

<p>"Early in the spring of 1772, we sent a boat-load of provisions,
but it came back on the 20th day of June, bringing with it, to
our surprise, the whole establishment of miners. They reported
that, in the course of the winter, they had penetrated forty feet
into the face of the hill, but, on the arrival of the thaw, the clay,
on which, on account of its stiffness, they had relied, and neglected
to secure it by supporters, had fallen in. That, from the
detached masses of metal which, to the last, had daily presented
themselves, they supposed there might be ultimately reached a
body of the same, but could form no conjecture of its distance,
except that it was probably so far off as not to be pursued without
sinking an air shaft. And, lastly, that the work would require
the hands of more men than could be fed in the actual
situation of the country.</p>

<p>"Here our operations, in this quarter, ended. The metal was
probably within our reach, but, if we had found it, the expense
of carrying it to Montreal must have exceeded its marketable
value. It was never for the exportation of copper that our company
was formed, but always with a view to the silver, which it
was hoped the ores, whether of copper or lead, might in sufficient
quantity contain."&mdash;<i>Travels and Adventures of Alexander Henry.</i></p>

<p>[In the summer of 1832, being detained by head winds at the
mouth of Miner's River, on Lake Superior, I observed the names
of several persons engraved on the sand rock, but much obliterated
by the water's dashing over the rock. Tradition represents
that Henry's miners were detained there, and that they made explorations
of the river, which is named from the circumstance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
The stream is a mere brook, coming over the shelving sand rock,
which is a part of the precipitous range of the Pictured Rocks.]</p>

<p>Sir A. Mackenzie passed through Lake Superior, on his first
voyage of discovery, in 1789. He remarks: "At the River Tennagon
(Ontonagon) is found a quantity of virgin copper. The
Americans, soon after they got possession of the country, sent
an agent thither; and I should not be surprised to hear of their
employing people to work the mine. Indeed, it might be well
worthy the attention of the British subjects to work the mines
on the north coast, though they are not supposed to be so rich as
those on the south."&mdash;<i>Voyages from Montreal through the Continent
of North America.</i></p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive what, however, is apparent, from the
references of Dr. Franklin to the subject, that the supposed mineral
riches of Lake Superior had an important bearing on the discussions
for settling the ultimate northern boundary of the United
States. The British ambassadors had, it seems, from an old map
which is before me, claimed a line through the Straits of Michilimackinac
and the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, to the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>The attention of the United States Government appears first
to have been turned toward the subject during the administration
of President John Adams, when the sudden augmentation of the
navy rendered the employment of copper in the equipment of
ships an object of moment. A mission was therefore authorized
to proceed to Lake Superior, of the success of which, as it has
not been communicated to the public, nothing can, with certainty,
be stated; but from inquiries which have been made during the
recent expedition, it is rendered probable that the actual state of
our Indian relations, at the time, arrested the advance of the
officer into the region where the most valuable beds of copper
were supposed to exist, and that the specimens transmitted to
Government were procured through the instrumentality of some
friendly Indians, employed for the purpose.</p>

<p>Such are the lights which those who have preceded me in this
inquiry have thrown upon the subject, all of which have operated
in producing public belief in the existence of extensive copper
mines on Lake Superior. Travellers have generally coincided
that the southern shore of the lake is most metalliferous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
that the Ontonagon River may be considered as the seat of the
principal mines. Mr. Gallatin, in his report on the state of American
manufactures in 1810, countenances the prevalent opinion,
while it has been reiterated in some of our literary journals, and
in the numerous ephemeral publications of the times, until public
expectation has been considerably raised in regard to them.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the recent expedition under Gov.
Cass entered the mouth of the Ontonagon River on the 27th of
June, having coasted along the southern shore of the lake from
the head of the River St. Mary. We spent four days upon the
banks of that stream, in the examination of its mineralogy, during
which the principal part of our party was encamped at the mouth
of the river. Gov. Cass, accompanied by such persons as were
necessary in the exploration, proceeded, in two light canoes,
to the large mass of copper which has already been described.
We found the river broad, deep, and gentle for a distance, and
serpentine in its course; then becoming narrower, with an increased
velocity of current, and, before reaching the Copper Rock,
full of rapids and difficult of ascent. We left our canoes at a
point on the rapids, and proceeded on foot, across a rugged tract
of country, around which the river formed an extensive semicircle.
We came to the river again at the locality of copper.
In the course of this curve the river is separated into two branches
of nearly equal size. The copper lies on the right-hand fork, and
it is subsequently ascertained that this branch is intercepted by
three cataracts, at which the river descends over precipitous cliffs
of sandstone. The aggregate fall of water at these cataracts has
been estimated at seventy feet.</p>

<p>The channel of the river at the Copper Rock is rapid and shallow,
and filled with detached masses of rock, which project above
the water. The bed of the river is upon sandstone, similar to
that under the Palisades on the Hudson. The waters are reddish,
a color which they evidently owe to beds of ferruginous clay.
The Copper Rock lies partly in the water. Other details in the
geological structure and appearance of the country are interesting;
but they do not appear to demand a more particular consideration
in this report.</p>

<p>During our continuance upon this stream, we procured from
an Indian a separate mass of copper weighing nearly nine pounds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
which will be forwarded to the War Department. This specimen
is partially enveloped with a crust of green carbonate of copper.
Small fragments of quartz and sand adhere to the under side,
upon which it would appear to have fallen in a liquid state.
Several smaller pieces of this metal were procured during our
excursion up the Ontonagon, or along the shores of the lake east
of this stream.</p>

<p>It may be added that discoveries of masses of native copper,
like those of gold and other metals, are generally considered
indicative of the existence of mines in the neighborhood. The
practical miner regards them as signs which point to larger bodies
of the same metals, in the earth, and he is often determined by
discoveries of this nature in the choice of the spot for commencing
his labors. The predictions drawn from such evidence are more
sanguine in proportion to the extent of the discovery. They are
not, however, unerring indications, and appear liable to many
exceptions. Metallic masses are sometimes found at great distances
from their original repositories; and the latter, on the contrary,
sometimes occur in the earth, or imbedded in rock strata,
where there have been no great external discoveries.</p>

<p>From all the facts, which I have been able to collect on Lake
Superior, and after a full deliberation upon them since my return,
I have drawn the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the diluvial soil along the banks of the Ontonagon
River, extending to its source, and embracing the contiguous region,
which gives origin to the Monomonee River of Green Bay,
and to the Wisconsin, Chippewa, and St. Croix Rivers of the Mississippi,
contains very frequent, and several extraordinary masses
of native, or metallic copper. But that no body of this metal,
which is sufficiently extensive to become the object of profitable
mining operations, has yet been found at any particular place.
This conclusion is supported by the facts adduced, and, so far as
theoretical aids can be relied upon, by an application of those
facts to the theories of mining. A further extent of country might
have been embraced, along the shores of Lake Superior, but the
same remark appears applicable to it.</p>

<p>2. That a more intimate knowledge of the mineralogical resources
of the country, may be expected to result in the discovery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>of valuable ores of copper, in the working of which occasional
masses and veins of the native metal, may materially enhance
the advantages of mining. This inference is rendered probable
by the actual state of discoveries, and by the geological character
of the country.</p>

<p>These deductions embrace all I have to submit on the mineral
geography of the country, so far as regards the copper mines.
Other considerations arise from the facilities which the country
may present for mining&mdash;its adaptation to the purposes of agriculture&mdash;the
state and disposition of the Indian tribes, and other
topics which a design to commence metallurgical operations would
suggest. But I have not considered it incumbent upon me to
enter into details upon these subjects. It may, in brief, be remarked
that the remote situation of the country does not favor
the pursuit of mining. It would require the employment of a
military force to protect such operations. For, whatever may be
their professions, the Indian tribes of the north possess strong
natural jealousies, and in situations so remote, are only to be restrained
from an indulgence in malignant passions, by the fear of
military chastisement.</p>

<p>In looking upon the southern shore of Lake Superior, the period
appears distant, when the advantages flowing from a military
post upon that frontier, will be produced by the ordinary progress
of our settlements&mdash;for it presents but few enticements for the
agriculturalist. A considerable portion of the shore is rocky, and
its alluvions are, in general, of too sandy and light a character for
profitable husbandry. With an elevation of six hundred and
forty-one feet above the Atlantic, and drawing its waters from
territories situated north of the forty-sixth degree of north latitude,
Lake Superior cannot be represented as enjoying a climate
favorable to the productions of the vegetable kingdom. Its forest
trees are chiefly those of the fir kind, mixed with varieties of the
betula, lynn, oak, and maple. Meteorological observations indicate,
however, a warm summer, the average observed heat of the
month of June being 69. But the climate is subject to a long and
severe winter, and to sudden transitions of the summer temperature.
We saw no Indian corn among the natives.</p>

<p>A country lacking a fertile soil, may still become a rich mining
country, like the county of Cornwall in England, the Hartz Mountains
in Germany, and a portion of Missouri, in our own country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
But this deficiency must be compensated by the advantages of
geographical position, a contiguous or redundant population, partial
districts of good land, or a good market. To these, the mineral
districts of Lake Superior can advance but a feeble claim,
while it lies upwards of three hundred miles beyond the utmost
point of our settlements, and in the occupation of savage tribes
whose hostility has been so recently manifested.</p>

<p>Concerning the variety, importance, and extent of its latent
mineral resources, I think little doubt can remain. Every fact
which has been noticed tends to strengthen the belief that future
observations will indicate extensive mines upon its shores, and
render it an attractive field of mineralogical discovery. In the
event of mining operations, the facilities of a ready transportation
of the crude ores to the Sault de Ste. Marie, will point out that
place as uniting, with a commanding geographical position, superior
advantages for the reduction of the ores, and the general facilities
of commerce. At this place, a fall of twenty-two feet, in
the river, in the distance of half a mile, creates sufficient power
to drive hydraulic works to any extent; while the surrounding
country is such as to admit of an agricultural settlement.</p>

<p>I accompany this report with a geological sketch of a vertical
section of the left bank of the Mississippi at St. Peter's, embracing
a formation of native copper. This formation was first noticed
by the officers of the garrison, who directed the quarrying of stone
at this spot. The masses of copper found are small, none exceeding
a pound in weight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> Agreeably to your appointment as a member of the expedition
to explore the sources of the Mississippi, by the way of
the Lakes, I proceeded to join the party organized for that purpose
at Detroit, by His Excellency Lewis Cass. Diurnal notes
were kept of the changes in the geological features of the regions
visited; of the mineralogy of the country; and of such facts as
could be ascertained, with the means at command, to determine
its general physical character and value.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[209]</a></p>

<p>I have heretofore reported to you the facts and appearances
which indicate the existence of the ores of copper, and of valuable
deposits of copper in its native form, in the basin of Lake Superior&mdash;a
point which constituted one of the primary objects to
which my attention was called&mdash;and I now proceed to state such
particulars in the topics confided to me as fell within my observation.</p>

<p>In generalizing the facts, it must be observed that the expedition
had objects of a practical character relative to the number,
disposition, and feelings to be learned respecting the Indian tribes;
that the transit over large portions of the country was necessarily
rapid; and that few opportunities of elaborate or long-continued
observations occurred at any one point. The topography was
committed to a gentleman who is every way qualified for that
topic, who was well supplied with instruments, and who will do
ample justice to that department. I make these remarks to prepare
you for a class of observations which are necessarily technical,
and quite imperfect, and to which it is felt that it will not
be an easy task to impart a high degree of interest, whatever may
have been the anticipations.</p>

<p>To prepare the mind to appreciate the account which I give of
changes and developments in the physical structure of the country,
it may be observed that the American continent has experienced
some of the most striking mutations in its structure <i>at</i> and <i>north</i>
of the great chain of lakes. That chain is itself rather the evidence
of disruptions and upheavals of formations, which give its
northern coasts, to some extent, the character of ancient&mdash;very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>ancient&mdash;volcanic areas of action. These lakes form&mdash;except
Erie and Ontario&mdash;the general boundaries between the primitive
and secondary strata. But, however striking this fact may, at
particular localities, appear&mdash;such as at the Straits of St. Mary,
of which the east and west shores are, geologically, of different
construction&mdash;yet nothing in the grand phenomena of the whole
region visited is so remarkable as the boulder stratum, which is
spread, generally, from the north to the south. Some of the
blocks of rock are enormous, and would seem to defy any known
cause of removal from their parent beds; others are smaller, and
have had their angles removed, and far the greater number of
these transported boulders are quite smooth and rounded by the
force of attrition. This drift stratum has been tossed and scattered
from its northern latitudes over the surface of the limestones
and sandstones of the south. It is mixed with the diluvial soils,
in Michigan and elsewhere; but it is evident that, in its diffusion
south, the heavier pieces have settled first, while comparatively
minute boulders have been carried over or dropped in the plains
and prairies of Ohio, Illinois, and more southerly regions. Nobody,
with an eye to geology, can mistake the heavy boulder deposits
which mark the southern shores of Huron, and become still more
abundant on the St. Mary's, the shores of Lake Superior, and
along the channels of the River St. Louis and the Upper Mississippi.</p>

<p>Lake Superior has been the central theatre of volcanic upheavals;
but they must have operated at very remote periods,
for there is not only no evidence of existing volcanic fires, but the
heavy debris everywhere bespeaks long intervals of quietude, and
slow elementary degradation. Some of the upheavals were made
after the deposition of the sandstone rocks, which are, as at the
foot of the Porcupine Mountains, raised up to stand nearly vertical;
while other districts of the granitic rock, as at Granite
Point, had been elevated before the deposition of the sandstone
rock, which is accurately adjusted to its asperities, and remains
quite horizontal.</p>

<p>The granitical series of strata, which is apparent in northern
New York in the Kayaderasseras Mountains, and at the Thousand
Islands of the St. Lawrence, reappear on the north shores of
Huron and Superior, underlie the bed of the latter, and rise up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
in the rough coast between the Chocolate River and Kewaiwenon,
cross the Mississippi at the Petite Roche, above the Falls of St.
Anthony, and put out spurs as low down as the source of the
Fox, the St. Croix, and the head of the St. Peter's Rivers.</p>

<p>These glimpses of some of the leading points in the geological
structure of the regions visited, will enable you to follow my details
more understandingly. These details begin at Detroit. From
this place the expedition passed, by water, along the southern
shores of Lakes St. Clair, Huron, and Superior, to the Fond du
Lac; thence, up the River St. Louis, to the Savanne summit.
Thence we proceeded across the portage to Sandy Lake, which
has an outlet into the Mississippi, and followed up the latter,
through the lesser Lake Winnipek, to the entrance of the Turtle
River, in Cass, or upper, Red Cedar Lake, which is laid down by
Pike in north latitude 47° 42´ 40´´.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[210]</a> The state of the water was
unfavorable to going higher.</p>

<p>From this point, which formed the terminus of the expedition,
we descended the Mississippi, making portages around the Falls
of Pekagama and St. Anthony, to Prairie du Chien. An excursion
was made by me down the Mississippi to the mineral district
of Dubuque. We ascended the Wisconsin, to the portage into
the Fox River, and traced the latter down to its entrance into
Green Bay. At this point, the expedition separated; a part proceeding
north, through the bay, to Michilimackinac, and a part
going south, along the west shores of Lake Michigan, to Chicago,
the latitude of which is placed by Capt. Douglass in 41° 54´ 06´´.
At this place, a further division took place. Dr. Wolcott, having
reached his station, remained. Governor Cass proceeded across
the peninsula of Michigan to Detroit on horseback, leaving Capt.
Douglass and myself to complete the survey of Lake Michigan.
We rejoined the northern party detached at Green Bay, under Mr.
Trowbridge and Mr. Doty, at Michilimackinac; and, after repassing
the southern coast of Lakes Huron and St. Clair, reached
Detroit.</p>

<p>Topographically, a very wide expanse of wilderness country
had been seen. The entire length of route computed to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>been traversed, exceeds four thousand miles, in the course of
which we had crossed nineteen portages, over which all the baggage
and canoes were conveyed on the shoulders of men. We encountered
actual resistance from the Indians at only one point.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[211]</a>
I kept my journals continually before me, and had my pencil in
hand every morning as soon as it was light enough to discern objects.
I began my geological observations at Detroit.</p>

<p>This ancient city, founded by the French in 1701, stands upon
an argillaceous stratum, which is divided, topographically, into an
upper and lower bank. Wherever this clay has been examined
by digging, it discloses pebbles of various species of rock, denoting
it, as far as these extend at least, to be a part of the great
drift stratum.</p>

<p>In digging a well near the old Council House, in the northeast
part of the city, the top soil appeared to be less than two feet.
The workmen then passed through a stratum of blue clay, of eight
or ten feet, when they struck a vein of coarse sand, six or eight
inches in thickness, through which the water entered profusely.
The digging was carried through another bed of blue clay, twenty
or twenty-two feet in depth, when the men reached a stratum of
fine yellow sand, into which they dug three feet and stopped,
having found sufficient water. The whole depth of the well is
thirty-three feet. The water is clear and rapid. No vegetable
or other remains were found, and but few primitive pebbles.</p>

<p>In another well, situated near the centre of the town, the depth
of which is twelve feet, the top soil was found to be two feet and
a half; then a bed of gravel, seven feet; a vein of blue clay, eight
inches, and the residue a whitish-blue clay, very compact and
hard; a copious supply of water having been found. The water
is, however, slightly colored, and is of a quality called hard.</p>

<p>In some places, this clay drift yields balls of iron pyrites, which
renders the water unpalatable. At what depth the rock would
be struck, if the excavation were continued, can only be conjectured.
A well has been dug, a short distance below the city,
upwards of sixty feet, chiefly through clay and gravel, without
reaching the rock; but abraded fragments of granite and hornblende
rocks were thrown from the greatest depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
The bed of the river opposite the city has been stated to consist
of limestone rock, but without any proof or much probability.
From the fact of its affording a good anchorage to vessels, I am
inclined to think that it is wholly composed of clay and gravel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Detroit Fluviatile Clay.</span>&mdash;The argillaceous stratum of Detroit
extends along both banks of the river to its head; passes
around the shores of Lake St. Clair, and up the River St. Clair
to Fort Gratiot&mdash;a distance of seventy miles. In this distance
there are some moderate elevations and depressions in the surfaces
of the soil, but no very striking changes in its general character
and composition. The boulder stratum is prominent at
Gros Point, at the foot of Lake St. Clair, where the shore exhibited
some heavy blocks of granite, and other foreign rock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Clair Flats of Plastic Clay.</span>&mdash;At the mouth of the River
St. Clair, the current is divided into several channels, and spread
over a considerable tract of low ground, which is covered with
grasses and aquatic plants. These channels have worn their way
through beds of tough blue clay, called the flats, over which
there is sometimes not over seven feet eight inches of water in
the ship channel. They consequently form an impediment to
commerce. The depth is, however, always increased in the spring
season, when twelve inches more may be generally relied on.
Frequently, during the droughts of summer, a change of wind,
and its steady continuance for some time, will allow ships to pass
without lighters. The permanent removal of this bar is, however,
an object of national importance, which cannot but be felt, as the
tonnage of the lakes increases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ancient Dune; A Buried Forest.</span>&mdash;The principal spot where
the lands, in the immediate vicinity of the water, assume any considerable
or abrupt elevation, is included between Black River of
the St. Clair and Lake Huron. Here the outlet of the lake,
which is rapid, washes the base of a ridge, or ancient dune, elevated
fifty or sixty feet above the water. Fort Gratiot occupies
the upper part of this elevation. The lower part consists of the
blue clay stratum, corresponding in character with that found in
the wells of Detroit. It is overlaid by a deposit of sand, forming
two-thirds of the entire height. This elevation is crowned with
a light forest of oak and other species. At the line of junction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>between the sand and clay, a number of trees are seen to be horizontally
imbedded, projecting their roots and trunks in a striking
manner above the water. These trees, on inspection, are merely
preserved, not petrified. They appear to have been exposed to
view, in modern times, by the wearing away of the bank. Certainly,
none of the old travellers mention them.</p>

<p>The mode of this formation may be clearly seen. Winds, at
some ancient period, have been the agent of blowing the sands,
as they were washed up by the lake, and redepositing them on
part of a prostrated forest, resting directly on the clay stratum.
The trees, thus buried in dry sand, have been preserved. In
process of time, the river encroached upon these antique beds,
exposing them to view. There are also antique fresh-water shells
found in similar positions near this spot. No rock is, thus far,
found <i>in sitû</i> in ascending the lakes. The old surface of the
country is wholly of diluvial formation, except where it shows
lake action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huron Coast from Fort Gratiot to Michilimackinac.</span>&mdash;About
two hundred and thirty miles lie stretched out between
these two points. Lake Huron charms the eye, with the view of
its freshness and oceanic expanse. But the entrance is without
rock scenery, and the student of its geology must be a patient
gleaner along its shores. Long coasts of sand and gravel extend
before the eye, and they are surmounted, at a moderate elevation,
with a dense foliage, which limits the view of its structure to a
narrow line. Portions of this coast are heavily loaded with the
primitive debris<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[212]</a> from the North. These are found, in some
places, in heavy masses, but all are more or less abraded, showing
that they have been transported from their original beds. In
one of these, I observed crystals of staurotide.</p>

<p>The first section of this coast reaches from Fort Gratiot to
Point aux Barques, a distance of about seventy-five miles.
Nearly midway lies the White Rock, a very large boulder of
whitish-gray semi-crystalline limestone, lying off the shore about
half a mile, in water of about one and a half fathom's depth. It
is the effect of gulls lighting upon this rock, and not the intensity
of the color of the stone, that has originated the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>&mdash;which
is a translation of the <i>Roche Blanche</i> of the older <i>voyageurs</i>.
The Detroit clay-formation still characterizes the coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Emergence of Rock, in place, above the Surface.</span>&mdash;We
are passing, in this section, along and near to the outcrop of
the secondary strata of the peninsula, but these strata are covered
with a heavy deposit of diluvial clays, sands, and pebble drift.
The first emergence of fixed rocks, above the line of the drift,
occurs after passing Elm Creek in the advance to Ship Point
(<i>Pointe aux Barques</i>). It is a species of coarse gray, loosely compacted
sandstone, in horizontal layers. This rock continues to
characterize the coast to and around the Ship Point promontory
into Saganaw Bay. It possesses a few fossil remains of corallines;
but the rock is not of sufficient compactness and durability for
architectural purposes. It is conjectured to be one of the outlying
series of the coal measures, of which this coast exhibits,
further on, other evidences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saganaw Bay.</span>&mdash;The phenomena of this large body of water,
which is some sixty miles long, appear to indicate an original
rent in the stratification, having its centre of action very deep.
If the peninsula of Michigan be likened to a huge fish's head,
this bay may be considered as its open mouth. We crossed the
inner bay from Point aux Chenes, where it is estimated to be
twenty miles across.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[213]</a> The traverse is broken by an island, to
which the Indians, with us, applied the name of Sha-wan-gunk.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[214]</a>
It is composed of a dark-colored limestone, of dull and earthy
fracture and compact structure. It presents broken and denuded
edges at the water level. I observed in it nodular masses
of chalcedony and calc. spar. The margin of the island bears
fragments of the boulder stratum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Highlands of Sauble.</span>&mdash;On crossing the bay, these highlands
present themselves to view in the distance. They are the north-eastern
verge of the most elevated central strata of the peninsula.
Their structure can only be inferred from the formations along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>the margin of the lake, extending by Thunder Bay and Presque
Isle, and the Isles of Bois Blanc and Round Island to Michilimackinac.
At Thunder Bay, the compact limestone of the Saganaw
Islands reappears, and is constantly in sight from this point
to Presque Isle. It exists in connection with bituminous shale,
at an island in Thunder Bay. It is of a dark carbonaceous character
on the main opposite Middle Island, at a point which is
called by the Indians <i>Sho-sho-ná-bi-kó-king</i>, or Place of the Smooth
Rock. I noticed at this point the cyathophyllum helianthoides
in abundance, and easily detached them from the rock. The more
compact portions of this formation in the approach to Presque
Isle, disclosed the ammonite, two species of the gorgonia, and the
fragment of a species of chambered shell, whose character is indeterminate.</p>

<p>Much of the coast was footed, as the winds were adverse, and
its debris thus subjected to a careful scrutiny. Wherever the
limestone was broken up or receded from the water, long lines of
yellow beach-sand and lake-gravel, including members of the
erratic block stratum, intervened. In some localities, local beds
of iron sand occur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michilimackinac.</span><a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[215]</a>&mdash;The approach to this island was screened
from our view by the woody shores and forests of Bois Blanc, an
island of some twelve miles in length lying off the main land;
and the view of it first burst upon us in the narrow channel between
it and Round Island. It is a striking geological monument
of mutations. Here the calcareous rock, which had before exhibited
itself in low ledges along the shore is piled up in masses,
which reach an extreme altitude of three hundred and twelve
feet. About two hundred feet of this elevation is precipitous on
its south, east, and west edge. A hundred feet or more is piled
up on its centre, part rock and part soil, in a crowning shape.
The highest part of this apex, which is surmounted by the ruins
of Fort Holmes, consists of the drift stratum, among which are
boulders of sienite, and other foreign rocks. A locality of these
abraded boulder-rocks, near the Dousman farm, is worthy of a visit
from all who take an interest in the phenomena of boulders dispersed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
over the continent. The fishermen represent the water
around this island to be eighty fathoms in depth. Yet, across
these waters, to the utmost altitude of the island, these blocks of
foreign rock have been transported. No force capable of effecting
this is now known. And the argument of their having been
transported on cakes of ice, in the nascent periods of the globe, is
rendered stronger by these appearances than any geological proofs
which I have yet seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Distinctive Character of the Mackinac Limestone.</span>&mdash;Nothing
appears so completely to puzzle the observer as the first
glance at this rock. It is different in appearance from the calcareous
rocks, to which my attention has heretofore been called in
Western New York, and in Missouri and Illinois. The difficulty
is to find a point of comparison. I walked entirely around the
island, partly in water, the northern shores being comparatively
low. There appeared to be three layers. The first, which rises up
from the depths of the lake, scarcely, if at all, reaches the water
level. Upon this is superimposed a vesicular rock, of which the
vesicles are filled with carbonate of lime in the state of agaric
mineral. By exposure to the air, this substance readily decomposes,
and assumes an almost limey whiteness, and sometimes a
complete pulverulent state. The reticular, or vesicular lines, by
which the mass is held together, are thus weakened, and large
masses of the craggy parts fall, and assume the condition of
debris at the water's edge. Some conditions of the reticulated
filaments are covered with minute crystals of cal. spar; others of
minutely crystallized quartz. There appear, at other localities,
in low positions, layers of quartz in the condition of a coarse
bluish, flinty, striped agate. The entire stratum appears to be a
reproduced mass, which is plainly denoted, if I mistake not, by
some imbedded masses of an elder lime-rock. The whole stratum
is too shelly and fissured to be of value for economical purposes.
It yields neither quicklime nor building stone.</p>

<p>Fort Mackinac is erected on the summit of this stratum. The
two objects of curiosity, called the Arched Rock, and the point
called Robinson's Folly, are evidences of this tendency of the
cliffs to disintegration. The superior stratum which constitutes
the nucleus of the Fort Holmes' summit, contains more silex, diffused
throughout its structure. It is, however, of a loose, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
hard and shelly character; and has, in the geological mutations
of the island been chiefly demolished and washed away. The
monumental mass of this period of demolition, called the Sugar
Loaf, is a proof that it contained, either by its shape, or otherwise,
a superior power of resisting these means of ancient prostration.
Striking as it now appears, this is the simple story
which it tells. Its apex is probably level, or nearly so, with the
Fort Holmes's summit. Over the whole island, after these demolitions,
the drift stratum was deposited.</p>

<p>The German geognosts apply the term <i>mushelkalk</i>, to this species
of calcareous rock. It is, apparently, the magnesian limestone
of English writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ancient Water Lines.</span>&mdash;Such marks appear on the most
compact parts of the cliffs, denoting the water to have stood,
during the ancient boundaries of the lake, at higher levels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lake Action.</span>&mdash;It is known that strong currents set into the
Straits of Michilimackinac, and out of it, from Lake Michigan, at
this point. The fishermen, who set their nets at four hundred
feet in the waters, often bring up, entangled in their nets, large
compact masses of limestone, which have been fretted into a kind
of lacework, by the rotatory motion of little pebbles and grains
of sand, kept in perpetual motion by the water at the bottom of
the lake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Organic Impressions.</span>&mdash;There are cast up among the lake debris
of this island, casts of some species of orthocaratites, ammonites,
and madrepores, which appear to be derived from the calcareous
rocks in place in the basin of Lake Huron. But the
rock strata of the island itself appear to be singularly destitute
of these remains. The only species which I have noticed, is one
that was thrown up from a well attempted to be dug, on the apex
of Fort Holmes, by the British troops, while they held possession
of the island in 1813, 1814, and 1815. But this is uniformly
fragmentary. It has the precise appearance of the head of a trilobite,
but never reveals the whole of the lateral lobes, nor any
of the essential connecting parts. It is silicious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gyseus Formation.</span>&mdash;Evidences of the extension of this formation
to this vicinity were brought to my notice; in consequence
of which I visited the St. Martin's Islands, which belong to the
Mackinac group. Masses of gypsum were found imbedded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
soil, both of the fibrous and compact variety. These islands are
low diluvial formations. Similar masses are found on Goose
Island; and the mineral has been found at Point St. Ignace on
the main land.</p>

<p>Taken in connection with the discovery of this mineral, at a
subsequent part of the journey on Grand River, the indications
of the series of the saline group of rocks, so prevalent in the
Mississippi Valley, are quite clear up to this extreme point, which
is, however, very near the northern verge of this group.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honeycombed Rocks.</span>&mdash;As evidences of existing lake action,
it has already been mentioned that the fishermen bring up, from
great depths in the straits, pieces of compact limestone, completely
fretted and excavated by small pebbles, which are kept
in motion by the strong currents which prevail at profound
depths. The process of their formation by these currents is
such, as in some instances to give the appearance of cellepores,
and analogous forms of organic life. I have seen nothing in
these carious forms which does not reveal the mechanical action
of these waters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pseudomorphic Forms.</span>&mdash;Amongst the limestone debris, of
recent date, found on these shores, are pieces of rock which have
an appearance as if they had been punctured with a lancet, or
blade of a penknife. These incisions are numerous, and from
their regularity, appear to have been moulded on some crystals
which have subsequently decayed. Yet, there are difficulties in
supposing such to have been the origin of these small angular
orifices.</p>

<p>Whenever these masses are examined by obtaining a fresh
fracture, they are found to consist of the compact gray and semi-granular
rock of the inferior Mackinac group, but in no instance
of the vesicular or silicious varieties. These blocks appear to be
identical in character with the White Rock, before noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">North Shore of Lake Huron.</span>&mdash;The next portion of the
country examined was that of the north shores of the lake, extending
from Michilimackinac to Point Detour, the west Cape of
the Straits of St. Mary's, a distance computed to be forty miles.
The calcareous rock, such as it appears in the inferior stratum of
Mackinac, extends along this coast. The first three leagues of it,
consist of an open traverse across an arm of the lake. Goose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Island offers a shelter to the voyager, which is generally embraced.
It consists of an accumulation of pebbles and boulders
on a reef, with a light soil, resting on the lower limestone. It
does not, perhaps, at any point, rise to an elevation of more than
eight or ten feet above the water. Outard Point, a short league,
or rather three miles further, exhibits the same underlying formation
of rock, which is found wherever solid points put out into
the lake, during the entire distance. The chain of islands called
Chenos, extends about twenty miles, and affords shelter during
storms to boatmen and canoemen, who are compelled to pass this
coast. Large masses of the rock, with its angles quite entire, lie
along parts of the shore, and appear to have been but recently
detached. The intervals between these blocks and points of
coast, are formed of the loose sand and pebbles of the lake,
which are more or less affected by every tempest. The only organic
remains and impressions are drift-specimens, which have
been driven about by the waves, and are abraded. Broken
valves of the anadonta, occasionally found in similar positions,
denote that this species exists in the region, but that the outer
localities of the coast are entirely unfavorable to their growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drummond Island.</span>&mdash;This island, now in the possession of
British troops, who removed from Michilimackinac in 1816, is
the western terminus of the Manatouline chain. We did not
visit it, but learn from authentic sources, that it is a continuation
of the nether Mackinac limestone&mdash;and that the locality abounds
in loose petrifactions, which appear to have belonged to an upper
stratum of the rock, now disrupted.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[216]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Straits of St. Mary's.</span>&mdash;These straits, and the river which
falls into their head, connect Lakes Huron and Superior. They
appear to occupy the ancient line of junction between the great
calcareous and granitic series of rocks on the continent. The
limestone, which has been noticed along the north shore of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>Huron from Michilimackinac, and which continues, with interruptions
of water only, from Detour to Drummond Island, and
the Manatoulines, is to be noticed up the straits as high as Isle a
la Crosse, where the last locality of a pure carbonate of lime
appears to occur. The island of St. Joseph is chiefly primitive
rock, and its south end is heavily loaded with granitic, porphyritic,
and quartz boulders. The north shores of the river, opposite
and above this island, are entirely of the granitic series,
which continues to Gros Cape of Lake Superior. On reaching
the <i>Nebeesh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[217]</a> or Sailor's Encampment Island, sandstone rocks of
a red color present themselves, and are found also on the American
side of the river, and continue to characterize it to the Falls,
or Sault de Ste. Marie,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[218]</a> and to Point Iroquois and Isle Parisien
in Lake Superior.</p>

<p>The Sault of St. Mary's is <i>upon</i> and <i>over</i> this red sandstone.
The river makes several successive leaps, of a few feet at a time,
in its central channel, falling, altogether, about twenty-two feet in
half a mile. This gives it a foaming appearance, and the volume
pours a heavy murmur on the ear.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[219]</a> It is, of course, a complete
interruption to the navigation of vessels, which can, however,
come to anchor near its foot, while barges may be pushed up,
empty, on the American shore. The water-power created by
such a change of level, is such as must commend the spot, at a
future period, to manufacturers, lumbermen, and miners. The
foot of these falls is heavily incumbered, both with masses of the
disrupted sand-rock<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[220]</a> and granitic and conglomerate boulders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red Sandstone of Lake Superior.</span>&mdash;That this is the old red
sandstone, may be inferred simply from the fact that, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>deposited originally in horizontal beds, its position has been disturbed
in many localities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plastic Clay Stratum of the Lakes.</span>&mdash;The northern extremity
of Muddy Lake&mdash;a sheet of water some twenty miles in
length&mdash;is the head of the straits, and the beginning of the River
St. Mary's. This sheet of water has the property of being rendered
slightly whitish, or turbid, by continuous winds. Its bottom
appears to be formed of the same plastic blue clay which obstructs
the passage of vessels of large draft on the St. Clair flats, and
forms an impediment of a similar kind in this river in Lake
George. This stratum seems to be the result of causes not now
in operation. If dredged through, or excavated, there is no reason
to suppose it would again accumulate; for the waters of the
lake are clear and pure, and carry down no deposit of the kind.
These clay deposits remain to attest physical changes which are
past. They denote the demolition of formations of slate in the
upper regions, which have been broken down and washed away
when the dominion of the waters was far more potential than they
now are.</p>

<p>This formation is favorable to the growth of some species of
fresh-water shells. I observed several species of the anadonta
and the plenorbis, and think, from the broken valves, that research
would develop others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porphyry and Conglomerate Boulders.</span>&mdash;A formation of
red jasper, in common white quartz, exists, in the bed of intersection,
on the southeastern foot of Sugar Island. The fragments
of jasper are of a bright vermil red, quite opaque, and have preserved
their angles. I had observed fragments of the formation
along the shores of the lower part of the straits, and even picked
up some specimens, entirely abraded, however, on the south
shores of the Huron, between the White Rock and Michilimackinac&mdash;a
proof of the course of the drift.</p>

<p>The granitic conglomerates appear quite conclusive, one would
think, of the results of fusion. The attraction of aggregation
would seem inadequate to hold together such diverse masses. In
these curious and striking masses we see the red feldspathic
granite, black and shining hornblende rock, white fatty quartz,
and striped jasper, held together as firmly, and polished by attrition
as completely, as if they were&mdash;what they are not&mdash;the results
of crystallization in this aggregate form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Erratic Block Group.</span>&mdash;Wherever, in fact, the geologist sets
his foot, on the shores of the upper lakes, he finds himself on the
great drift stratum, and cannot but revert to that era when waters,
on a grander scale, swept over these plains, and the lakes played
rampantly over wider areas.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[221]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Basin of Lake Superior.</span>&mdash;We entered this island sea as if
by a kind of geological gate, in which the sandstone cliffs of Point
Iroquois, on the one hand, stand opposite to the granitical hills
of Gross Cape on the other.</p>

<p>In order to conceive of its geology, it may subserve the purposes
of description to compare it to a vast basonic crater. The
rim of this crater has been estimated, by Sir Alexander Mackenzie,
at fifteen hundred miles. The primitive formations of Labrador
and Hudson's Bay coasts come up, so as to form the eastern and
northern sides of the rim, around which they stand in cliffs of
sienitic greenstone and hornblendic rocks, in some places a thousand
feet high. On its south and southwest shores, this formation
of the elder class of rocks forms also a considerable portion of the
coast; as in the rough tract of Granite Point, the Porcupine and
Iron River Mountains, and the primitive tract west of Chegoimegon,
or Lapointe. It will serve to denote the broken character
of this rim, if we state that the entire plain of the lake, running
against and fitting to this rim, was originally filled up with the
red, gray, and mottled sandstone, which gave way and fell in at
localities west of the great Keweena Peninsula, converting its
bottom into an anteclinal axis.</p>

<p>Volcanic action, to which this disturbance in its westerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>bearings may be attributed, appears to have thrown up the
trap-rocks of the Pic, of the Porcupine chain, of the Isle Royal
group, and other trap islands, and the long peninsula of Keweena.
This system of forces appears to have spent itself from
the northeast to the southwest. The shocks brought with them
the elements of the copper and other metallic bodies which characterize
the trap-rock. They exhausted their power, on the
American side, west of the granitic tract of Chocolate and Dead
Rivers, and the Totosh and Cradle-Top Mountains. The most
violent disturbance took place at the west of the Keweena Peninsula,
and thence it was propagated in the direction of the
higher Ontonagon, the Iron, and the Montreal rivers.</p>

<p>This disturbance of the level of the sandstone produced undulations,
which are observable on the St. Mary's, where the variation
from a level is not more than eight or ten degrees. They left
portions of it&mdash;as between Isle au Train and the Firesteel River&mdash;undisturbed;
and they threw other portions of it&mdash;as between
Iron and Montreal rivers&mdash;almost completely on their edges.</p>

<p>The entire north shore from Gargontwa to the old Grand
Portage, inclusive of the Michepicotin and Pic regions, cannot be
particularly alluded to, as that part of the coast was not visited;
but the accounts of observers represent it as consisting of trap-rocks.
Without the application of such forces, it appears impossible
to understand the geology of this lake, or to account for the
sectional and disturbed formations.</p>

<p>The lake itself, whose depth is great, and which has an extreme
length of about 500 miles, by an extreme width of some 180, is
endowed with powerful means of existing elemental action. This
consists almost entirely of the force of its winds and long, sweeping
waves. Its bottom may, in this light, be looked upon as an
immense mortar or triturating apparatus, in which its sandstones,
trap-boulders, and pebbles are driven about and comminuted.
This power has greatly changed its configuration, and the process
of these mutations is daily going on.</p>

<p>It is only by such a power of geological action that we can
account for the powerful demolitions and inroads which it has
made upon some parts of its southern borders. The coasts of the
Pictured Rocks, which have a prominent development of about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>12 to 15 miles, consist in horizontal strata of coarse gray sandstone,
of little cohering power. The effect of waves beating upon
rocks is to communicate a curved line. This has operated to
excavate numerous and extensive caves into the coast. These,
after reaching hundreds of feet, have in some cases united. The
effect is to isolate portions of the coast, and to leave it in fearful
pinnacles, having many of the architectural characters of Gothic
or Doric ruins.</p>

<p>The portion of coast immediately west of Grand Marrais is
scarcely less unique. It denotes the effect of the prostrating
power of the lake in another way. The sandstone of parts of
the coast, ground down into yellow sand by this vast machinery,
is lifted up by the winds as soon as it reaches the point of dryness,
and heaped up into vast dunes. Standing trees are buried
in these tempests of sand, and its effect is, for about nine miles
along the coast, to present, at an elevation of several hundred
feet, a scene of arid desolation, which can only be equalled by
the Arabic deserts.</p>

<p>A dyke of trap seems once to have extended from the north
shore to Point Keweena; but, if so, it has been prostrated, and
its contents&mdash;veins and deposits, silicious and metallic&mdash;scattered
profusely around the shores of the lakes. A cause less general
is hardly sufficient to account for the wide distribution of fragments
of the copper veins and vein-stones which have so long
been noticed as characters of this lake. The basal remains of this
antique dyke form the peninsula of Keweena. The tempests
beating against this barrier from the northwest, have ripped up
terrific areas from the solid rock, and left its covering, amygdaloid
and rubblestones, in fantastic patches upon the more solid
parts, or constituting islands in front of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Structure of its Southern Coast.</span>&mdash;The estimated distance
from Sault Ste. Marie to Fond du Lac is a fraction over 500 miles.
The sandstone, as it appears in the Falls of the St. Mary's, does
not appear to be entirely level. It exhibits an undulation of
about 8° or 10°, dipping to west-northwest. Two instances of
this waved stratification of the Lake Superior sandstone deserve
notice. The first terminates at the intersection of red sand rock
at la Point des Grande Sables with the beginning of the horizontal
strata of the Pictured Rocks. We again observe an inclination
of the strata of a few degrees at Grand Island, which is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>ingfish
River, and appears to dip at Isle aux Trains, about twenty
miles northeast. The scenery is peculiarly soft and pleasing in
passing the Huron Islands, a granitic group, and directing the
view, as in the sketch, to the coast and the rough granitical hills
rising behind Huron Bay. The strata are level, as shown above,
around the Bay of Presque Isle and Granite Point, and continue
so, resting on the roots of the granitical tract of the <i>Tötosh</i>, or
Schoolcraft, and Cradletop Mountains, and at Point aux Beignes,
and Keweena Bay. This level position of the rock is preserved
to the south cape of the shallow bay of the Bete Gre, on the
north, at which the trap-dykes of the peninsula first begin; and
so continues after passing that rugged coast of the vitreous series
of that remarkable point, to and beyond Eagle River and Sandy
Bay, in the approach to the portage of the Keweena.</p>

<p>The same horizontality is observed on the headland west of it,
and upon all the points and headlands to Misery and Firesteel
Rivers and the mouth of the Ontonagon. The trap-dyke of Keweena
crosses this river about ten miles, in a direct line, inland.</p>

<p>At Iron River, we observe a stratum of compact gray grauwacke,
over the hackly bed of which that river forces its way
during the spring months, and stands in tanks and pools during
the summer. On reaching the foot of the Porcupine Mountains,
the sandstone, which is here of a dark chocolate color, with quartz
pebbles of the bigness of a pigeon's egg, and organic remains of
paleozoic type, is found to be tilted up into nearly a vertical position,
as shown in the sketch. The grauwacke reappears, in a most
striking manner, at the Falls of Presque Isle River, where the
whole mass of water precipitated from the highlands drops into
a vast pot-hole, a hundred feet wide and perhaps twice that depth.
The whole upper series of rocks, from the Porcupine Cliffs west
to the Montreal River, is a conglomerate. At the Falls of the
Montreal, the river drops over the vertical edges of the red sandstone.
Beyond the Bay of St. Chares, at Lapointe Chegoimigon,
masses of sienitic mountains arise, which have their apex near La
Riviere de Fromboise.</p>

<p>The Islands of the Twelve Apostles, or Federation Group,
appear to be all based on the sienitic or trap, with overlying red
sandstone; which latter again reappears on the point of the
entrance into Fond du Lac Bay, and marks its southern coast, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
near the entrance of the Brulé, or Misakoda River, as seen in the
illustration beneath. Shores of sand then intercept its view to
the entrance of the River St. Louis, and up its channel to its first
rapids, about eighteen miles, where the red sandstone again
appears, as the first series of the Cabotian Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serpentine Rock.</span>&mdash;At the nearest point north of Rivier du
Mort is a headland of this rock, jutting out from the granitical
formation. Lapping against it, at the mouth of the river, is a
curious formation of magnesian breccia. The serpentine rock
appears, in nearly every locality examined, to be highly charged
with particles of chromate of iron. It may be expected to yield
the usual magnesian minerals.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[222]</a> Its position is between the Carp
River and Granite Point, in the Bay of Presque Isle, or rather
Chocolate River, for that river pours into this bay by far the
largest quantity of water.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[223]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ancient Drift-Stratum.</span>&mdash;In the intervals between the points
and headlands, where the rock formation is exposed by streams
or gorges, the drift, or erratic boulder stratum, is found. Such
is its position beneath the sand-dunes of the Grandes Sables, and
in the elder plains and uplands, stretching with interruptions on
the coast from the head of the Mary's valley to that of the St.
Louis. The edge of this formation is composed of the sand and
loose pebbles and boulders of the lake. Mighty as are the existing
causes of action of the lake in beating down and disrupting
strata of every kind, and in reproducing alluvial lands and dunes,
they are weak and local when compared to the causes which have
spread these ponderous boulders, and drift masses over latitudes
and longitudes which appear to be limited only by the leading
elevations of the continent. That oceanic torrents of water, suddenly
heaped on the land, and wedged into compactness and
power now unknown to it, is after all, the most plausible theory
of the dispersion of this formation, and this theory avoids the
necessary local one of the glacial dispersion which presupposes a
very low temperature over the whole surface of the globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Kaugwudju.</span><a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"
href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[224]</a>&mdash;This imposing mass of the trap-rocks is the
highest on the southern shores of Lake Superior. The following
outlines of it are taken from a point on the approach to the Ontonagon
River, about forty miles distant.</p>

<p>They rise to their apex about thirty miles west of that stream,
in north lat. 46° 52´ 2´´, as observed by Captain Douglass. They
are distant three hundred and fifty miles from St. Mary's. In a
serene day they present a lofty outline, and were seen by us from
the east, at the distance of about eighty miles. The Indians represent
them to have a deep tarn, with very imposing perpendicular
walls, at one of the highest points. If Lake Superior be
estimated at six hundred and forty feet above the Atlantic, as my
notes indicate, its peaks are higher than any estimates we have of
the source of the Mississippi, and are, at least, the highest
elevations on this part of the continent. The granitical tract
of the St. Francis, Missouri,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[225]</a> and of the quartz high lands of
Wachita, Arkansas, the only two known primitive elevations between
the Rocky and Alleghany chains, are far less elevated.</p>

<p>I have now taken a rapid glance at the formations along the
southern shore of the lake between St. Mary's and Fond du Lac;
but have passed by some features which may be thought to merit
attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Existing Lake Drift.</span>&mdash;The gleaner among the rock debris
of this lake has a field of labor which is not dissimilar to that of
the fossilist. If he has not, so to say, to put joint to joint, to
establish his conclusions, he has a mineralogical adjustment to
make every way as obscure. A boulder of sienite, or a mass of
sandstone, or grauwacke, may be easily referred to a contiguous
rock. But when the observer meets with species which are apparently
foreign to the region, he is placed in a dilemma between
the toil of an impossible scrutiny and the danger of an unlicensed
conjecture.</p>

<p>Among the more common masses which may be assigned a
locality within the compass of the lake, are granites, sienites,
hornblendes, greenstones, schists, traps, grauwackes, sandstones,
porphyries, quartz rocks, serpentines, breccias, amygdaloids, amphiboles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and a variety of masses in which epidote and hornblende
are essential constituents. With these, the coast mineralogist
must associate, in place or out of place, agates, chalcedonies,
carnelians, zeolite, prehnite, calcareous spar, crystalline quartz,
amethystine quartz, coarse jaspers, noble serpentine, iron-sand,
iron-glance, sulphate of lead, chromate of iron, native copper,
carbonate of copper, and various species of pyrites. These were,
at least, my principal rewards for about eighteen days' labor, in
scrutinizing, at every possible point, its lengthened and varied
coasts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cupreous Formation.</span>&mdash;The whole region, above Grand Island
at least, appears to have been the theatre of trap-dykes, and
an extensive action from beneath, which brought to the surface
the elements of the formation of copper veins. These have not
been much explored; but, so far as observation goes, there are
evidences which cannot be resisted, that the region contains this
metal in various shapes and great abundance. I refer to my report
of the 6th of November, 1820, for evidences of a valuable
deposit of this metal in the valley of the Ontonagon River, and at
other points. I found the metal in its native state at various
other localities, and always under physical evidences which denoted
its existence, in the geological column of the lake, in quantity.
These indications were confined almost exclusively to the
area intervening between the peninsula of Keweena, and La
Pointe Chegoimegon, a distance of about one hundred and fifty
miles. Of this district, the two extremities would make the Ontonagon
Valley about the centre.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[226]</a> A profile of one of the detached
pieces, found in the Ontonagon Valley, and forwarded to
you by Mr. Van Rensselaer, is herewith given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vitric Boulders.</span>&mdash;Among the debris of Lake Superior are
masses of trachyte, and also small pieces of the sienitic series,
in which the red feldspar has a calcined appearance, the quartz
being, at the same time, converted into a perfectly vitreous
texture. Similar productions, but not of the same exact character,
exist on the sandy summits of the Grande Sable. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>exhibit an exterior of glistening cells or orifices: it may be possible
that they have been produced by fusion; but I think not.
The smooth cells appear like grains of sand hurled by the winds
over these bleak dunes. I have brought from that locality a
single specimen of pitchstone, perfectly resinous, bleak and
shining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">La Pointe Chegoimegon.</span>&mdash;A sketch of these islands, as given
in the Narrative, denotes that their number is greatly underrated,
and will serve to show the configuration of a very marked part
of the Superior coast. It must, hereafter, become one of the
principal harbors and anchoring-ground for vessels of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valley of the St. Louis River.</span>&mdash;The St. Louis River takes
its rise on the southern side of the Hauteur des Terres, being the
same formation of the drift and erratic block stratum which
gives origin, at a more westerly point, to the Mississippi. Its
tributaries lie northwest of the Rainy Lakes. Vermilion Lake,
a well-known point of Indian trade, is a tributary to its volume,
which is large, and its outlet rushes with a great impetus to the
lake. At what height its sources lie above Lake Superior, we
can only conjecture. It was estimated to have a fall of two hundred
and nine feet to the head of the Portage aux Coteaux, and
may have a similar rise above.</p>

<p>By far its most distinguishing feature is its passage at the
Grand Portage through the Cabotian Mountains. We entered it
at Fond du Lac and pursued up its channel through alluvial
grounds, in which it winds with a deep channel about nineteen
or twenty miles to the foot of its first rapids. This point was
found one mile above the station of the American Fur Company's
trading-house. Here we encountered the first rock stratum, in
the shape of our old geological acquaintance, the old red sandstone
of Lake Superior. It was succeeded in the first sixteen
miles, in the course of which the river is estimated to fall two
hundred feet&mdash;most of it in the first twenty-nine miles&mdash;by trap,
argillite, and grauwacke. Through these barriers the water forces
its way, producing a series of rapids and falls which the observer
often beholds with amazement. The river is continually in a
foam for nine miles, and the wonder is that such a furious and
heavy volume of water should not have prostrated everything before
it. The sandstone, grauwacke, and the argillite, the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
of which stands on its edges, have opposed but a feeble barrier;
but the trap species, resisting with the firmness, as it has the color
of cast-iron, stand in masses which threaten the life and safety of
everything which may be hurled against them. I found a loose
specimen of sulphuret of lead and some common quartz in place
in the slate rock, a vein of clorite slate, and a locality of coarse
graphite, to reward my search.</p>

<p>The Portage aux Coteaux, which is over the basetting edges of
the argillite, will give a lively idea of the effects of this rock
upon the feet of the loaded voyageurs.</p>

<p>The sandstone is last seen near the Galley on the Nine Mile
Portage. Above the Knife Portage, some eight miles higher,
vast black boulders of hornblendic and basaltic blocks, are more
frequent; and these masses are observed to be more angular in
their shapes than the boulders and blocks of kindred character
encountered on the shores of Lakes Superior and Huron. There
is a vast sphagnous formation, which spreads westwardly from
the head of the Coteau Portage, and gives rise to the remote tributaries
of Milles lac and Rum River. Much of this consists of
what the Indians term <i>muskeeg</i>, or elastic bog. Hurricanes and
tempests have made fearful inroads upon areas of its timber, and
it is seldom crossed, even by the Indians. This tract lies east of
the summit of sand-hills and drift, which environ Sandy Lake, the
<i>Komtaguma</i> of the Chippewas. The portage of the Savanna
River, a tributary of the St. Louis, is the route pursued by persons
with canoes; there is no other species of water craft adapted
to this navigation. But wherever crossed, this swamp-land
tract imposes labor and toil which are of no ordinary cast. It is
the equivalent of the argillite which has been broken down and
disintegrated, forming beds of clay soil which are impervious to
the water, and we way regard this ancient slate formation of
the true source of the St. Lawrence tributaries, as the remote
origin of those extensive beds of an argillaceous kind, which
exist at many places in the lower lakes and plains.</p>

<p>Immediately west of the Savanna Portage, the Komtaguma
summit is reached. This summit consists wholly of arid pebble
and boulder drift of the elder period. It exhibits evidences of
broken-down amygdaloids, which not only furnish a part of its
pebbles, but also of the contents of this stratum, in numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
agates and other subspecies of the quartz family which are found
scattered over the surface. This is, in fact, the origin of that
extensive diffusion of these species, which is found in the valley
of the Upper Mississippi, as at Lake Pepin, &amp;c., and which
has even been traced, in small pieces, as low as St. Louis and
Herculaneum in Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[227]</a> We may conclude that the ancient
sandstones, slates, and rubblestone, and amygdaloids, of which
traces still remain, were swept from the summit of the Mississippi
by those ancient floods which appear to have diffused the boulder
drift from the North.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandy Lake.</span>&mdash;The first view of this body of water was obtained
from one of those eminences situated at the influx of the
west Savanna River.</p>

<p>This lake is bounded, on its western borders, by the delta of the
Mississippi; its outlet is about two miles in length. We here
first beheld the object of our search. The soil on its banks is of
the richest alluvial character. From this point, dense forests and
a moderately elevated soil, varying from three or four to fifteen
feet, confined the view, on either side, during more than two days'
march. On the third day after leaving Sandy Lake, at an early
hour, we reached the Falls of Pakágama. Here the rock strata
show themselves for the first time on the Mississippi, in a prominent
ledge of quartz rock of a gray color. Through this formation
the Mississippi, here narrowed to less than half its width,
forces a passage. The fall of its level in about fifty rods may be
sixteen or eighteen feet. There is no cascade or leap, properly so
called, but a foaming channel of extraordinary velocity, which it
is alike impossible to ascend or descend with any species of water
craft. It lies in the shape of an elbow. We made the portage
on the north side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pakágama Summit.</span>&mdash;The observer, when he has surmounted
the summit, immediately enters on a theatre of savannas, level to
the eye, and elevated but little above the water. Vistas of grass,
reeds, and aquatic plants spread in every direction. On these
grassy plains the river winds about, doubling and redoubling on
itself, and increasing its cord of distance in a ratio which, by the
most moderate computation, would seem extravagant. On those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>plateaux, and the small rivers and lakes connected with them, the
wild rice reaches the highest state of perfection.</p>

<p>Our men toiled with their paddles till the third day, through
this unparalleled maze of water and plants, when we reached the
summit of the Upper Red Cedar or Cass Lake, where we encamped.
In this distance no rock strata appeared, nor any formation
other than a jutting ridge of sand, or an alluvial plain.
Plateau on plateau had, indeed, carried us from one level or basin
to another, like a pair of steps, till we had reached our extreme
height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cass Lake Basin.</span>&mdash;From estimates made, this lake is shown
to lie at thirteen hundred and thirty feet above the Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[228]</a>
This is a small elevation, when we consider it as lying on the
southern flank of the transverse formation which forms the connecting
link with the Rocky Mountains. A rise or a subsidence
of this part of the continent to this amount, would
throw the Hudson's Bay and Arctic waters down the Mississippi
valley. The scenery of its coasts is in part arenaceous plains,
and in part arable land, yielding corn to the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sources of the Mississippi.</span>&mdash;In order to understand the
geology of this region, it is necessary to premise, that the St.
Lawrence, the Hudson's Bay, and the Mexican Gulf waters are
separated by a ridge or watershed of diluvial hills, called the
Hauteur des Terres, which begins immediately west of the basin
of the Rainy Lakes and Rainy Lake River. This high ground
subtends the utmost sources of the Mississippi, and reaches to the
summit of Ottertail Lake, where it divides the tributaries of the
Red River of Lake Winnepec from those of the Des Corbeau, or
Great Crow-Wing River.</p>

<p>Within this basin, which circumscribes a sweep of several
hundred miles, there appears to have been deposited, upon the
trap and primary rocks which form its nucleus, a sedimentary
argillaceous deposit, capable of containing water. Upon this, the
sand and pebble drift reposes in strata of unequal thickness, and
the sand is often developed in ridges and plains, bearing species
of the pine. The effect has been, that the immense amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>vapor condensed upon these summits, and falling in dews, rains,
and snows, being arrested by the impervious subsoil of clay, has
concentrated itself in innumerable lakes, of all imaginable forms,
from half a mile to thirty miles long. These are connected by a
network of rivers, which pour their redundancy into the Mississippi,
and keep up a circulation over the whole vast area. The
sand plains often resting around the shores of these lakes create the
impression of bodies of water resting on sand, which is a fallacy.
Some of these bodies of water are choked up, or not well drained,
and overflow their borders, forming sphagnous tracts. Hence the
frequent succession of arid sand plains, impassable muskeegs, and
arable areas on the same plateaux. Every system of the latter, of
the same altitude, constitutes a plateau. The highest of these is
the absolute source of the Mississippi waters. The next descending
series forms another plateau, and so on, till the river finally
plunges over St. Anthony's Falls.</p>

<p>In this descending series of plateaux, the Cass, Leech Lake, and
Little Lake Winnipec form the third and fourth levels.</p>

<p>In descending the Mississippi below the Pakágama, the first
stratum of rock, which rises through the delta of the river,
occurs between the mouth of the Nokasippi and Elm Rivers,
below the influx of the Great De Corbeau. This rock, which
is greenstone trap, rises conspicuously in the bed of the stream,
in a rocky isle seated in the rapid called&mdash;I know not with
what propriety&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Big Falls</span>, or <i>Grande Chute</i>. The precipitous
and angular falls of this striking object decide that
the bed of the stream is at this point on the igneous granitical
and greenstone series. This formation is seen at a few
points above the water, until we pass some bold and striking
eminences of shining and highly crystalline hornblendic sienite,
which rises in the elevation called by us Peace Rock, on the
left bank, near the Osaukis Rapids. This rock lies directly
opposite to the principal encampment on the 27th of July, which
was on an elevated prairie on the west bank. To this point a
delegation of Sioux had ascended on an embassy of peace from
Fort Snelling to the Chippewas, having affixed on a pole what
the exploring party called a bark letter, the ideas being represented
symbolically by a species of picture writing, or hieroglyphics.
In allusion to this embassy, this locality was called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Peace Rock. This rock is sienite. It is highly crystalline, and
extends several miles. Its position must be, from the best
accounts, in north latitude about 44° 30´. From this point to
Rum River, a distance of seventy miles, no other point of the
intrusion of this formation above the prairie soil was observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Introduction of the Palæontological Rocks.</span>&mdash;After passing
some fifty miles below this locality there are evidences that
the river, in its progress south, has now reached the vicinity of
the great carboniferous and metalliferous formations, which, for
so great a length, and in so striking a manner, characterize both
banks of the Mississippi below St. Anthony's Falls. About nine
or ten miles before reaching these Falls, this change of geological
character is developed; and on reaching the Falls the river is
found to be precipitated, at one leap, over strata of white sandstone,
overlaid by the metalliferous limestone. The channel is
divided by an island, and drops in single sheets, about sixteen to
eighteen feet, exclusive of the swift water above the brink, or of
the rapids for several hundred yards below. This sandstone is
composed of grains of pure and nearly limpid quartz, held together
by the cohesion of aggregation. If my observations were
well taken it embraces, sparingly, orbicular masses of hornblende.
It is horizontal, and constitutes, in some places, walls of stratification,
which are remarkable for their whiteness and purity. This
sandstone is overlaid by the cliff limestone, the same in character,
which assumes at some points a silicious, and at others, a magnesian
character. It is manifestly the same great metalliferous
rock which accompanies the lead ore of Missouri and mines of
Peosta or Dubuque. There rests upon it the elder drift stratum
of boulders, pebble, and loam, which marks the entire valley.
This latter embraces boulders of quartz and hornblende rock,
along with limestones and sandstones. It is overlaid by about
eighteen inches of black alluvial carbonaceous mould.</p>

<p>From St. Anthony's Falls the river is perpetually walled on
either side with those high and picturesque cliffs which give it
so imposing and varied an appearance, and its current flows on
with a majesty which seems to the imagination to make it rejoice
in its might, confident of a power which will enable it to reach
and carry its name to the ocean in its unchanged integrity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Peter's River and Valley.</span>&mdash;The importance, fertility,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and value of this tributary have particularly impressed every
member of the party. Its position as the central point of the
Sioux power, and its border position to the Chippewas, the representative
tribe of the great Algonquin family, render it now a
place of note, which fully justifies the policy of the department in
establishing a military post at the confluence of the river; and
the importance cannot soon pass away, in the progress of the settlement
of the Mississippi Valley.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[229]</a> It is the great route of communication
with the valley of the Red River of the North, and
the agricultural and trading settlements of Lord Selkirk in that
fertile valley, and its complete exploration by a public officer is
desirable, if not demanded.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[230]</a></p>

<p>Of its geological character but little is known, and that connects
it with both the great formations which have been noticed
as succeeding each other at the great Peace Rock. That the
granitical formation reaches it at a high point is probable, from
the large reported boulders. The Indians bring from the blue
earth fork of it, one of their most esteemed green and blue argillaceous
pigments, of which the coloring matter appears to be carbonate
of copper. They also bring from the Coteau des Prairie,
probably Carver's "shining mountains," specimens of that fine
and beautiful red pipe stone, which has so long been known to be
used by them for that purpose. This mineral is fissile, and moderately
hard, which renders it fit for their peculiar ripe sculptures.
I found small masses of native copper in the drift stratum at the
mouth of this stream, on the top of the cliffs on the Mississippi,
opposite the mouth of the St. Peter's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crystalline Sand Rock.</span>&mdash;This stratum reveals the same
crystalline structure which is so remarkable in the sandstone
caves, near the Potosi road, in the county of St. Genevieve,
Missouri; and the sand obtained from it, like that mineral, would
probably fuse, with alkali, in a moderate heat, and constitute an
excellent material for the manufacture of glass. It is also, like
the Missouri sandstone, cavernous. In both situations, these
caves appear to be due to water escaping through fissures of the
rock, where its cohesion is feeble, carrying it away grain by grain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
In stopping at one of these caves, about twelve miles below St.
Peter's, we found this cause of structure verified by a lively spring
and pond of limpid water flowing out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valley of the St. Croix.</span>&mdash;This river originates in an elevated
range of the elder sand and pebble drift, which lies on the
summit between the Mississippi system of formations, and the
Lake Superior basin. It communicates with the Brulé, which is
"Goddard's River" of Carver, and with the Mauvaise or Bad
River of that basin. Specimens of native copper have been found
on Snake River, one of its tributaries.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[231]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Monuments.</span>&mdash;In descending the river for the
distance of about one hundred miles below St. Anthony's Falls,
my attention was arrested, on visiting the high grounds, by a
species of natural monuments, which appear as if made by human
hands seen at a distance, but appear to be the results of the
degradation and wasting away, on the Huttonian theory, of all
but these, probably harder, portions of the strata.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lake Pepin.</span>&mdash;This sheet commends itself to notice by its
extent and picturesque features. It is an expansion of the river,
about twenty-four miles long, and two or three wide. Both its
borders and bed reveal the drift stratum, and the observer recognizes
here, boulders of the peculiar stratification which has, in
ancient periods, characterized the high plateaux about the sources
of the river. Such are its hornblendic, sienite, quartz, trap, and
amygdaloid pebbles, and that variety of the quartz family which
assumes the form of the agate and other kindred species. Moved
as these materials are annually, lower and lower, by the impetus
of the stream, other supplies, it may be inferred, are still furnished
by the shifting sand and gravel bars from above. The mass must
submit to considerable abrasion by this change, and the diminished
size of the drifted masses become a sort of measure of the distance
at which they are found from their parent beds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chippewa River.</span>&mdash;This stream is the first to bring in a vast
mass of moving sand. Its volume of water is large, which it
gathers from the high diluvial plains that spread southwest of
the Porcupine Mountains, and about the sources of the Wisconsin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the Montreal, and the St. Croix Rivers, with which it
originates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trompeldo</span> (<i>Le Montaine des Tromps d'Eaux</i>).&mdash;This island
mountain stands as if to dispute the passage of the Mississippi,
whose channel it divides into two portions. Distinct from its
height, which appears to correspond with the contiguous cliffs,
and in the large amount of fresh debris at its base, it presents
nothing peculiar in its geology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Painted Rock.</span>&mdash;This vicinity is chiefly noted for its large and
fine specimens of fresh-water shells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wisconsin.</span>&mdash;Like the Chippewa, this stream brings down in
its floods, vast quantities of loose sand, which tend to the formation
of bars and temporary islands. It originates in the same
elevated plains, and bespeaks a considerable area at its sources,
which must be arid. It is a region, however, in which lakes and
rice lands abound, and it may, in this respect, be geologically of
the same formation as the higher plateaux of the Mississippi,
above the Sandy Lake summit. Its sides produce many species
to enrich our fresh-water Conchology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead Mines of Peosta and Dubuque.</span>&mdash;In my researches
into the mineral geography of Missouri, in 1818 and 1819, I had
explored a district of country between the rivers Merrimak and
St. Francis, and on the Ozarks, which revealed many traits which
it has in common with the Upper Mississippi. There, as here,
the mineral deposits appear to be, in many cases, in a red
marly clay, whether the clay is overlaid by the calcareous rock
or not. There, as here, also, the limestone and sandstone strata
are perfectly horizontal. The leads of ore appear, in this section,
to be followed with more certainty, agreeable to the points of the
compass; but this may happen, to some extent, because the practice
of mining on individual account, with windlass and buckets,
in the Missouri district, has led common observers to be more
indifferent to exact scientific methods. To say that the digging,
at these mines, is equally, or more productive, is perhaps just.
Capital and labor have been rewarded in both sections of the
country, in proportion as they have been perseveringly and
judiciously expended.</p>

<p>I found much of the ore, which is a sulphuret, at Dubuque's
Mines, lying in east and west leads. These leads were generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
pursued in caves, or, more properly, fissures in the rock. In one
of the excavations which I visited, the digging was continued
horizontally under the first stratum of rock, after an excavation
had been made perpendicularly, through the top soil and calcareous
rock, perhaps thirty feet. The ore is a broad-grained cubical
galena, easily reduced, and bids fair very greatly to enhance
the value and resources of this section of the West.</p>

<p>Similar mines exist at Mississinawa, and the River Au Fevé,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[232]</a>
both on the eastern or left bank of the Mississippi. And a system
of leasing or management, such as I have suggested for the
Missouri mines, appears equally desirable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quartz Geodes.</span>&mdash;The amount of silex in the cliff limestone is
such, in some conditions of it, as to justify the term silico-calcareous.
This condition of the rock at the passage of the Mississippi
through the Rock River and Des Moines Rapids, is such as
to produce a very striking locality of highly crystalline quartz
geodes, which accumulates in the bed of the stream. Many of
these geodes are from a foot to twenty-two inches in diameter,
and on breaking them they exhibit resplendent crystals of limpid
quartz. Sometimes these are amethystine; in other cases they
present surfaces of chalcedony or cacholong. The latter minerals,
if obtained from the rock, and before unduly hardening by exposure,
would probably furnish a suitable basis for lapidaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Intermediate Country in the Direction to Green Bay.</span>&mdash;There
is a line which separates, on the north, the granitical and
trap region from the metal-bearing limestone, and its supporting
sandstone. This formation of the elder series of rocks, having
been traced to the south shore of Lake Superior, and having
been seen to constitute the supporting bed of the alluviums and
diluviums of the Upper Mississippi, above the Peace Rock, it
may subserve the purpose of inquiry to trace this line of junction
by its probable and observed boundaries.</p>

<p>The line may be commenced where it crosses the Mississippi,
at the Peace Rock, and extended to the St. Croix, the falls of
which are on the trap-rock, to the sources of the Chippewa at
Lac du Flambeau, and the Wisconsin near Plover Portage. The
source of Fox River runs amid uprising masses of sienite, and
this formation appears to pass thence northeasterly, across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>Upper Menominee, to the district of the Totosh and Cradle-Top
Mountains, west of Chocolate River, on the shores of Lake
Superior.</p>

<p>I observed the crystalline sandstone and its overlying cliff
limestone, along the valley of the Wisconsin, where ancient excavations
for lead ore have been made. There is an entire preservation
of its characters, and no reason occurs why its mineralogical
contents should not prove, in some positions, as valuable as they
have been found in Missouri, or in the Dubuque district west of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>On reaching the Wisconsin Portage, the limestone is found to
have been swept by diluvial action, from its supporting sand rock.
Such is its position not far north of the highest of the four lakes,
and again at Lake Puckway, in descending the Fox River;
consequently, there are no lead discoveries in this region. On
coming to the calcareous rock, which is developed along the channel
of the river, below Winnebago Lake, it appears rather to
belong to the lake system of deposits. Its superior stratum
lies in patches, or limited districts, which appear to have been
left by drift action. Petrefactions are found in these districts,
and the character of the rock is dark, compact, or shelly. The
lower series of deposits, such as they appear at the Kakala
Rapids, at Washington Harbor, in the entrance to Green Bay,
and in the cliffs north of Sturgeon Bay and Portage, are manifestly
of the same age and general character as the inferior stratum
of Michilimackinac and the Manatouline chain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Basin of Lake Michigan.</span>&mdash;This basin, stretching from the
north to the south nearly four hundred miles, lies deeply in the
series of formation of limestones, sandstone, and schists, to which
we apply the term of the Michilimackinac system. Its north and
west shores are skirted from Green Bay to a point north of the
Sheboygan, with the calcareous stratum. At this point, the
ancient drift, the lacustrine clay of Milwaukie and the prairie diluvium
of Chicago, constitute a succession, of which the surface
is a slightly waving line of the most fertile soils.</p>

<p>Among the pebbles cast ashore at the southern head of this lake
I observed slaty coal. It seems, indeed, the only one of the lakes
which reaches south into the coal basin of Illinois. If the level
at which coal is found on the Illinois were followed through, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
would issue in the basin of the lake below low-water mark.
Digging for this mineral on the Chicago summit, promises indeed
not to be unsupported by sound hypothesis.</p>

<p>After passing Chicago, of which a sketch is added, the sands
which begin to accumulate at the Konamik, the River du Chemin,
and the St. Joseph's River,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[233]</a> appear in still more prominent
ridges, skirting the eastern coasts to and beyond Grand River.
These sands, which are the accumulations of winds, are cast on
the arable land, much in the manner that has been noticed at the
Grand Sable on Lake Superior, and reach the character of striking
dunes at the coast denominated the Sleeping Bear. The
winds which periodically set from the western shore, produce
continual abrasions of its softer materials, and are the sole cause
of these intrusive sand-hills. Pent up behind them, the water is
a cause of malaria to local districts of country, and many of the
small rivers upon this side are periodically choked with sand. The
sketch transmitted of this bleak dune-coast (omitted here), as it is
seen at the mouth of Maskigon Lake, will convey a false idea of
the value of this coast, even half a mile from the spot where the
surf beats. It is designed to show the air of aridity which the
mere coast line presents. The stratification regains its ordinary
level and appearance before reaching the Plate or Omicomico
River, and the peninsula of the Grand Traverse Bay, and the
settlements of the Ottawa Indians on Little Traverse Bay, afford
tracts of fertile lands. Point Wagonshonce consists of a stratum
of limestone of little elevation, which constitutes the southeast
cape of the strait. Here a lighthouse is needed to direct the
mariner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lake Huron.</span>&mdash;Notices of this sheet of water have been given
in our outward voyage. It appears rather as the junction of
separate lakes which have had their basins fretted into one another,
than as one original lake. Michigan is connected with it through
the Straits of Michilimackinac. The Georgian Bay, north of the
Manatouline chain, seems quite distinct. The Saganaw Bay is an
element of another kind. The Manitouline chain separates the
calcareous and granitic region, and its numerous trap and basaltic
islands towards the north shore, of which there are many thousands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
denote that it has been the scene of geological disturbance
of an extraordinary kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulterior Conclusions.</span>&mdash;In taking these several views of the
geological structure of the Northwest&mdash;of the Lake Superior
basin, and of the valleys of the St. Louis River&mdash;the region about
the Upper Mississippi, its striking change at the Falls of St. Anthony&mdash;and
the valleys of the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers, and
the basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron, I am aware of the
temerity of my task. Allowance must, however, be made for the
rapidity of my transit over regions where the question was often
the safety and personal subsistence of the party. A very large
and diversified area was passed over in a short time. At no
place was it possible to make elaborate observations. A thousand
inconveniences were felt, but they were felt as the pressure
of so many small causes impeding the execution of a great enterprise.
A sketch has been made, which, it is hoped, will reveal
something of the physical history and lineaments of the country.
These glimpses at wild scenes, heretofore hid from the curious
eye of man, have been made, at all points, with the utmost
avidity. I have courted every opportunity to accumulate facts,
and I owe much to the distinguished civilian who has led the
party so successfully through scenes of toil and danger, not always
unexpected, but always met in a calm, bold, and proper spirit,
which has served to inspire confidence in all; to him, and to
each one of my associates, I owe much on the score of comity
and personal amenity and forbearance; and I have been made to
feel, in the remotest solitudes, how easy it is to execute a duty
when all conspire to facilitate it.</p>

<p>The views herein expressed are generalized in two geological
maps (hereto prefixed), which, it is believed, will help to fix the
facts in the mind. They exhibit the facts noticed, in connection
with the theory established by them, and by all my observations,
of the construction of this part of the continent.</p>

<p>The mineralogy of the regions visited is condensed in the following
summary, drawn from my notes, which, it is believed,
constitutes an appropriate conclusion to this report.</p>

<p>With the exception of one species, namely, the ores of copper,
the region has not proved as attractive in this department as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
found the metalliferous surface of Missouri. There are but few
traces of mining, and those of an exceedingly ancient character,
in the copper region of Lake Superior. The excavations in search
of lead ore on the Upper Mississippi do not date back many years,
but the indications are such as to show that few countries, even
Missouri, exceed them in promises of mineral wealth.</p>

<p>I have employed the lapse of time between the termination of
the exploration and the present moment, to extend my mineralogical
observations to some parts of the Mississippi Valley which
were not included in the line of the expedition, but which were
visited in the following year, in the service of the Government,
namely, the Miami of the Lakes, and Wabash Valleys, the Cave
in Rock Region in Lower Illinois, and the Valley of the River
Illinois. The whole is concentrated in the following notices:&mdash;</p>

<p class="section"><span class="large">a. <i>Metallic Minerals.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">1. Copper.</span></p>

<p>This metal is frequently found, in detached masses, in the diluvial
soil along the southern shore of Lake Superior, and in the
high and barren tract included between Lakes Huron, Michigan,
and Superior, and the Mississippi River, as general boundaries.
Thus, it has been found upon the sources of the Menomonie,
Wisconsin, Chippewa, St. Croix, and Ontonagon Rivers, but
most constantly, and in the greatest quantity, upon the latter.
There are many localities known only to the aborigines, who
appear to set some value upon it, and have been in the habit of
employing the most malleable pieces in several ways from the
earliest times. It occurs mostly in detached masses, resting upon,
or imbedded in, diluvial soil. These masses, which vary in size,
are sometimes connected with isolated fragments of rock. Such
is the geognostic position of the great mass of native copper upon
the banks of the Ontonagon, which has been variously estimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
to weigh from two to five tons. This extraordinary mass is
situated at the base of a diluvial precipice composed of reddish
loam and mixed boulders and pebbles of granite, greenstone,
quartz, and sandstone and diallage rocks. The nearest strata, in
situ, are red sandstone, grauwacke, and greenstone trap. A company
of miners was formerly employed in searching for copper
mines upon the banks of this river. They dug down about forty
feet into the diluvial soil, at a spot where a green-colored water
issued from the hill. In sinking this pit, several masses of native
copper were found, and they discovered, as their report indicates,
the same metal "imbedded in stone." But the enterprise was
abandoned, in consequence of the falling in of the pit.</p>

<p>At Keweena Point, on Lake Superior, I found native copper
along the shore of the lake, constituting small masses in pebbles,
and, in one instance, in a mass of several pounds' weight, which
was found in the Ontonagon Valley. I also observed the green
carbonate of copper, in several places, in the detritus. The strata
of this point appear to be charged with this mineral, particularly
in its native forms. Hardly a mass of the loose rock is without
some trace of the metal, or its oxides or salts. It would be difficult,
on any known principles, to resist the testimony which is
offered, by every observer, to favor the idea that extensive and
very valuable mines exist. The whole lake shore, from this
peninsula to the Montreal River, is replete with these evidences.</p>

<p>There are indications that this mineral pervades the rocks and
soils, in a radius of one hundred and fifty miles or more, south
and west of this central point. It has been discovered at the
sources of the Menominee, Chippewa, Montreal, and St. Croix,
and even at more distant points.</p>

<p>At St. Peter's, in digging down for the purpose of quarrying
the rock, about eighteen inches depth of dark alluvium was
passed; then a deposit of diluvial soil, with large fragments of
limestone, greenstone, quartz rock, &amp;c., about six feet; and, lastly,
one foot of small pebbles, &amp;c., constituting the copper diluvium.
No large mass was found; nor any veins in the rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p class="subsection">2. Lead.</p>

<p>The only ore of lead known to exist within the limits to which
these remarks are confined, is the sulphuret. In the year 1780,
Peosta, a woman of the Misquakee, or Fox tribe of Indians, discovered
a lead mine upon the west banks of the Mississippi, at
the computed distance of twenty-five leagues below Prairie du
Chien, which the Indians, in 1788, gave Julian Dubuque a right
to work. This permission was partially confirmed by the Baron
de Carondelet, Governor of Louisiana, in 1796. No patent was,
however, issued; but Dubuque continued to prosecute the mining
business to the period of his death, which happened in 1810, when
the mines were again claimed by the original proprietors.</p>

<p>The ore is the common sulphuret of lead, or galena, which Dubuque
stated to have yielded him seventy-five per cent. in smelting
in the large way. He usually made from 20,000 to 40,000
pounds per annum.</p>

<p>I made a cursory visit to these mines, and found them worked
by the Fox Indians, but in a very imperfect manner. They cover
a considerable area, commencing at the mouth of the Makokketa
River, sixty miles below Prairie du Chien. Traces of the ore are
found, also, on the east bank of the Mississippi at several points.
It occurs disseminated in a reddish loam, resting upon limestone
rock, and is sometimes seen in small veins pervading the rock;
but it has been chiefly explored in diluvial soil. It generally
occurs in beds having little width, and runs in a direct course
towards the cardinal points. They are sometimes traced into a
crevice of the rock. At this stage of the pursuit, most of the
diggings have been abandoned. Little spar or crystalline matrix
is found in connection with the ore. It is generally enveloped
by a reddish, compact earth, or marly clay. Occasionally, masses
of calcareous spar occur; less frequently, sulphate of barytes, green
iron earth, and ochrey brown oxide of iron. I did not observe
any masses of radiated quartz, which form so conspicuous a trait
in the surface of the metalliferous diluvion of the mining district
of Missouri.</p>

<p>Sufficient attention does not appear to have been bestowed, by
mineralogists, upon the metalliferous soil of the Mississippi Valley.
It is certainly very remarkable that such vast deposits of lead ore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
accompanied by veins of sulphate of barytes, calc spar, and other
crystallized bodies, should be found in alluvial beds; and it would
be very interesting to ascertain whether any analogous formations
exist in Europe, or in any other part of the earth's surface. It
is one of the most striking features of this deposit, that the ore,
spars, &amp;c., do not appear as the debris of older formations, and
have no marks of having been worn or abraded, like those extraneous
masses of rock which are very common in the alluvial
soil of our continent. The lead ore and accompanying minerals
appear to have been crystallized in the situations where they are
now found. We should, perhaps, except from this remark the
species of lead called <i>gravel ore</i> by the miners, which is in rounded
lumps, and is never accompanied by spars.</p>

<p>Sulphuret of lead is also found near the spot where the small
River Sissinaway enters the Mississippi, and two leagues south of
it, upon the banks of the River Aux Fevre, at both of which
places considerable quantities have been raised, and continue to
be raised, for the purposes of smelting, by the Fox and Sac tribes
of Indians. At these places, it is most frequently connected with
a gangue of heavy spar and calcareous spar, with pyrites of iron.
I procured from a trader, at Dubuque, several masses of galena
crystallized in cubes and octahedrons.</p>

<p>In descending the Upper Mississippi, a specimen of galena was
exhibited to me, by a Sioux Indian, at the village of the Red
Wing, six miles above Lake Pepin, said to have been procured
in that vicinity. Galena is also reported to have been discovered
in several places on the south side of the Wisconsin River, and
these localities may be entitled to future notice, as furnishing important
hints.</p>

<p class="subsection"> 3. Zinc.</p>

<p>The sulphuret of zinc (black blende) is found disseminated in
limestone rock along the banks of Fox River, between the post
of Green Bay and Winnebago Lake. Although frequently seen
in small masses, no body of it is known to exist. I also found
blende, in small, orbicular masses of calcareous marl, along the
east shore of Lake Michigan, between the Rivers St. Joseph and
Kikalemazo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p class="subsection">4. Iron.</p>

<p>This mineral is distributed, in several of its forms, throughout
the region visited, although but little attention has yet been
directed to its exploration. In the basin of Lake Superior it
exists, in valuable masses, in the form of a magnetic oxide, on the
coasts of the lake between Gitchi Sebing (Great River), called by
the French Chocolate River, and Granite Point. Specimens from
Dead River (Riviere du Morts) and Carp River, the Namabin of
the Indians, in this district, denote the latter to be the chief locality.
It is the iron glance, and occurs in mountain masses.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuret of Iron.</i>&mdash;This variety is found, in limited quantities,
in a state of crystallization, in clay beds, on the west shore of
Lake Michigan, between Milwaukie and Chicago. It is frequently
in the form of a cube or an octahedron. Some of the crystals are
in lumps of several pounds' weight, with a metallic lustre. Often
the masses, on being broken, are found radiated, sometimes cellular,
and occasionally irised.</p>

<p><i>Iron Sand.</i>&mdash;The breaking-up and prostration of the sandstone
and other sedimentary formations, along the shores of lakes Michigan,
Huron, and Superior, liberates this ore in considerable quantities.
It arranges itself, on the principle of its specific gravities,
in separate strata along the sandy shores, where it invariably
occupies the lowest position at and below the water's edge. The
shores of Fond du Lac, on Lake Superior, may be particularly
mentioned as an abundant locality.</p>

<p><i>Micaceous Oxide of Iron.</i>&mdash;In detached mass, among the debris
of the River St. Louis and of Fond du Lac. It exists in veins
in the clay slate which characterizes the banks of this river.</p>

<p><i>Ochrey Red Oxide of Iron.</i> (Red ochre)&mdash;Is produced near a spot
called the Big Stone, on the head of the River St. Peter's. It is
said to occur in a loose form, in a stratum of several inches thick,
lying below the soil of a level dry prairie or plain. The Sioux
Indians, who employ it as a paint, make this statement. The
color of a portion given to me by them is of a bright red; and a
considerable proportion of the mass is in a state of minute division.
Particles of quartz are occasionally mixed with it. This
ore of iron is also represented to be found in the prairies north of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Gros Point, along the west shore of Lake Michigan, between Milwaukie
and Chicago.</p>

<p>Ochrey red oxide of iron occurs on the shores of Big Stone
Lake, at the source of the St. Peter's River. A large spring rises
from a level, dry plain, a few feet beyond which the mineral
occurs. The Indians, who employ it as a pigment, take it up
with their knives. The stratum is about eight inches thick, but
just below the surface it is mixed with common earth. The spring
of water is pure and unadulterated.</p>

<p class="subsection">5. Silver.</p>

<p>The belief in the existence of silver ore in the region of the
lakes, and particularly on Lake Superior, seems to have early
prevailed. So much confidence was placed in the reports of its
existence, that Henry tells when a company was formed in England
for exploring the copper mines of Lake Superior (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1771),
they were impelled to the search more from an expectation of the
silver, which it was hoped would be found in connection with it,
than from the copper.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[234]</a></p>

<p class="section">b.<span class="large"> <i>Silicious Minerals.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">1. Quartz.</span></p>

<p>This interesting species being distributed in its numerous varieties
throughout the region visited, I shall confine my notices
to a few localities.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 1.&mdash;<i>Common Quartz.</i></p>

<p>Occurs in the form of large water-worn masses along the shores
of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior. Also, in veins in the
granite of Lake Superior, and in the argillite of St. Louis River.
These localities all consist of the opaque varieties, with a slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>degree of translucence in some places. It exists in mass at Huron
Bay, Lake Superior, and in fragments of red jasper on Sugar
Island, St. Mary's River.</p>

<p>1. <i>Radiated Quartz.</i>&mdash;In detached masses on the Grange, and
also at the rapids of the River Desmoines, on the Upper Mississippi.
At the Grange, the crystals, which are usually minute,
sometimes possess a cinnamon color, or pass into a variety of
crystallized ferruginous quartz.</p>

<p>2. <i>Tabular Quartz.</i>&mdash;In small, flattened masses along the shores
of Lake Pepin. These masses are transparent, or only translucent.
Their color is generally white, but sometimes yellow.
They appear to be closely allied to chalcedony.</p>

<p>3. <i>Greasy Quartz.</i>&mdash;In detached masses along the shores of
Lake Superior.</p>

<p>4. <i>Granular Quartz.</i>&mdash;At the Falls of Puckaiguma, on the Upper
Mississippi, in large, compact beds rising through the soil. Also,
in some conditions of the cliffs commencing at the Falls of St.
Anthony, Carrer's Cave, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. <i>Arenaceous Quartz.</i>&mdash;This is sometimes the condition of fine,
even-grained, translucent sand rock of the preceding localities.
Valuable as an ingredient of glass.</p>

<p>6. <i>Pseudomorphous Quartz.</i>&mdash;On the shores of Lake Pepin, occasionally.
These masses appear to have taken their crystalline
<i>impress</i> from rhomboidal crystals of carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>7. <i>Amethystine Quartz.</i>&mdash;In the trap-rock of Lake Superior.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 2.&mdash;<i>Amethyst.</i></p>

<p>This mineral occurs most frequently in the condition of amethystine
quartz, in hexahedral prisms, lining the interior of geodes,
in the bed of the River Desmoines, and on the Rock Rapids, in
the channel of the Mississippi. The crystals which I have examined
are generally limpid, with a high lustre, and of a pale
violet color. Sometimes the tinge of color approaches to a full
red, or is only apparent in the summit of the crystal. These
geodes are sometimes eight or ten inches in diameter, with a
rough and dark-colored exterior, often so nearly spherical as to
resemble cannon <i>balls</i>. Some of the finest specimens I have observed
from this locality are preserved in the museum of Gov.
Clarke, at St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 3.&mdash;<i>Ferruginous Quartz.</i></p>

<p>In amorphous masses, of a deep-red, brown, or yellowish-red
color, along the southern shore of Lake Superior. Likewise,
crystallized, in very minute hexagonal prisms, terminated by six-sided
pyramids, of a reddish color, on the summit and declivities
of the Grange de Terre.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 4.&mdash;<i>Prase.</i></p>

<p>In the drift of Lake Superior. Its color is a light green and
not fully translucent. It possesses a hardness and a lustre intermediate
between waxy and resinous.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 5.&mdash;<i>Chalcedony.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Common Chalcedony.</i>&mdash;In globular or reniform masses imbedded
in trap-rock, on the Peninsula of Keweena, Lake Superior.
It is found sometimes in association with other quartz
minerals. Its color is white or gray, sometimes veined or spotted
with red. Also, constituting the interior lining of geodes at the
rapids of Rock Island and the River Desmoines. These geodes,
on breaking, often present a mammillary surface. In the form
of translucent fragments, with a highly conchoidal fracture, among
the debris of the shores of Lake Pepin. These fragments possess
an extremely delicate texture, color, and lustre.</p>

<p>2. <i>Cacholong.</i>&mdash;Some loose fragments of this mineral exist along
the west shore of Lake Michigan, between Green Bay and Chicago.
These fragments possess small cavities studded over with very
minute and perfect crystals of quartz.</p>

<p>3. <i>Carnelian.</i>&mdash;This mineral occurs in fragments in the debris
of Lake Superior; also, in the amygdaloid; also, around the
shores of the Upper Mississippi. Its color is various shades of
red, or yellowish red, sometimes spotted or clouded, fully translucent,
and occasionally presenting a considerable richness and
beauty. Most commonly, the fragments are too small to be applied
to the purposes of jewelry. Sometimes it is seen in very
regular spheroidal masses, which contain a nucleus of radiated
quartz. Some of the specimens would be considered as sardonyx.</p>

<p>4. <i>Agate.</i>&mdash;Is found with the preceding. It is more frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>found in larger masses, in the rock, which are sometimes spheroidal,
reniform, or globular. These agates are chiefly arranged
in concentric layers, which are white, red, yellow, &amp;c., according
to the colors of the different varieties of chalcedonies, carnelians,
&amp;c., of which they are composed. A close inspection would also
separate them into several varieties&mdash;as onyx, agate, dotted agate,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 6.&mdash;<i>Hornstone.</i></p>

<p>In nodular or angular masses, imbedded in the secondary limestone
of the west shores of Green Bay; and in the beds of argillaceous
white clay strata of Cape Girardeau, of Missouri. Also,
on the hills of White River, Arkansas.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 7.&mdash;<i>Jasper.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Common Jasper.</i>&mdash;In detached fragments, yellow, in the drift
of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>2. <i>Striped Jasper.</i>&mdash;With the preceding. Most commonly, these
specimens consist of alternate bands of red and black, or brown.</p>

<p>3. <i>Red Jasper.</i>&mdash;In quartz rock, Sugar Island, River St. Mary's,
Michigan. Masses of this mineral have been met in situ.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 8.&mdash;<i>Heliotrope.</i></p>

<p>A fine specimen of this mineral, now before me, was procured
at the mouth of the Columbia River, Oregon. It is in the form
of an Indian dart. Its color is a deep uniform green, variegated
with small spots of red; those parts which are green being fully
translucent, the others less so, or nearly opaque. This beautiful
mineral is represented to have been in common use by the Indian
tribes of the Northwest Coast, for pointing their arrows, previous
to the introduction of iron among them. It differs chiefly from
the dotted jaspers of Lake Michigan, in its translucence and green
color.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 9.&mdash;<i>Opal.</i></p>

<p>Common opal occurs as a constituent of agate, along with
chalcedony rarely, in the drift on the south shore of Lake
Superior.</p>

<p class="subsection">2. Silicious Slate.</p>

<p>1. <i>Common.</i>&mdash;In subordinate beds, in the argillite of the River
St. Louis, northwest of Lake Superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
2. <i>Basanite</i> (<i>Touchstone</i>).&mdash;In detached fragments in the drift on
Lake Superior, and along the banks of the Upper Mississippi
generally.</p>

<p class="subsection">3. Petrosilex.</p>

<p>In large isolated masses in the bed of the Illinois River, on the
shallow rapids between the junction of the Fox and Vermilion
Rivers. It is mostly arranged in stripes or circles of white, gray,
yellow, &amp;c., resembling certain jaspers, or approaching sometimes
to hornstone. The bed of the Illinois River, at this place, is a
species of gray sandstone. Also, in detached fragments, on the
south shore of Lake Superior, intimately mixed with prehnite.
In regard to the latter, Professor Dewey, of Williamstown College,
writes me: "I have received from Dr. Torrey, a curious
mixture of petrosilex and prehnite, in imperfect radiating crystals,
which was sent him by you and collected at the West. He
did not tell me the name, but examination showed what it was.
The association is singularly curious." The locality of this mineral
is Keweena Point, Lake Superior.</p>

<p class="subsection">4. Mica.</p>

<p>Occurs rarely in the granite of Lake Superior. It is found in
place on the Huron Islands. Also, in minute folia, in the alluvial
soil of the Upper Mississippi. A beautiful aggregate, consisting
of plates of gold-yellow mica, connected with very black and
shining crystals of schorl, has been dug up from the alluvial soil
of the Island of Michilimackinac.</p>

<p class="subsection">5. Schorl.</p>

<p>1. <i>Common Schorl.</i>&mdash;In crystals, in boulders of granite, at Green
Bay.</p>

<p>2. <i>Tourmaline.</i>&mdash;With the preceding.</p>

<p class="subsection">6. Feldspar.</p>

<p>As an ingredient in the granite of Huron Islands, Lake Superior.
Also, in detached masses of granite along the west shores
of Lake Michigan. Also, in the form of prismatic crystals of a
light-green color, in the rolled masses of hornblende, porphyry,
greenstone, and epidotic boulders of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and
Superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p class="subsection">7. Prehnite.</p>

<p>This mineral occurs at Keweena Point, on Lake Superior. It
is found in connection with isolated blocks of amygdaloid, of
primitive greenstone, and of petrosilex. Sometimes native copper,
and carbonate of copper, are also present in the same specimen.
In some instances, a partial decomposition has taken place,
converting its green color into greenish-white, or perfect white,
and rendering it so soft as to be cut with a knife. Sometimes
the grains or masses of native copper are interspersed among the
prehnite, and slender threads of this metal occasionally pass
through the aggregated mass of greenstone, prehnite, &amp;c., so that,
on breaking it, the fragments are still held together by these
metallic fibres.</p>

<p class="subsection">8. Hornblende.</p>

<p>1. <i>Common Hornblende.</i>&mdash;Occurs as a constituent of the hornblende
rocks near Point Chegoimegon, Lake Superior. Also, at
the Peace Rock, on the Upper Mississippi, and in certain granite
aggregates, and rolled masses of porphyries, &amp;c., around the shores
of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior.</p>

<p>2. <i>Actynolite.</i>&mdash;In slender, translucent, greenish crystals, pervading
rolled masses of serpentine, on the west shores of Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p class="subsection">9. Woodstone.</p>

<p>1. <i>Mineralized Wood.</i>&mdash;In bed of the River Des Plaines, Illinois.</p>

<p>2. <i>Agatized Wood.</i>&mdash;This variety of fossil wood is found along
the alluvial shores of the Mississippi and of the Missouri.</p>


<p class="section">c. <span class="large"><i>Calcareous Minerals.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Carbonate of Lime.</span></p>

<p>Of a substance so universally distributed throughout the western
country, it will not be necessary to give many localities, and these
will be principally confined to its crystalline forms.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 1.&mdash;<i>Calcareous Spar.</i></p>

<p><i>Crystallized Calcareous Spar.</i>&mdash;This mineral occurs, in minute
rhomboidal crystals, in the calcareous rock of the Island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Michilimackinac. Sometimes these crystals fill cavities or seams
of the rock, or are studded over the angular surfaces of masses of
vesicular limestone of that island. I also found this mineral at
Dubuque's mines, and in small crystals in the metalliferous limestone
bordering the Fox River, between the post of Green Bay
and Winnebago Lake, where it is associated with iron pyrites
and blende.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 2.&mdash;<i>Compact Limestone.</i></p>

<p>In proceeding northwest of Detroit, this mineral is first observed,
in situ, on an island in Lake Huron. It is afterwards found to
be the prevailing rock along the south and southwest shores of
Lake Huron. In many places, it incloses fossil remains. Sometimes
it is <i>earthy</i>, as at Bay De Noquet, a part of Green Bay, on
Lake Michigan, where it contains very perfect remains of the
terrebratula. (Parkinson.) In other places, no remains whatever
are visible, and the structure is firm and compact; or even passes,
by a further graduation, into transition-granular, of which, it is
believed, the west shores of Lake Michigan afford an instance. It
is most commonly based upon sandstone, which also contains, in
many places, the fossil organized remains of various species of
crustaceous animals, and of vegetables, sometimes, coal, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 3.&mdash;<i>Agaric Mineral.</i></p>

<p>This mineral substance occurs in crevices and cavities in the
calcareous rock of the Island of Michilimackinac, Michigan.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">Subs. 4.&mdash;<i>Concrete Carbonate of Lime.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Calcareous Sinter.</i>&mdash;In the form of <i>stalactites</i> and <i>stalagmites</i>,
in a cave situated near Prairie du Chien, on the Upper Mississippi.</p>

<p>2. <i>Calcareous Tufa.</i>&mdash;A remarkable formation of tufa is seen
on the east banks of the Wabash River, near Wynemac's Village,
about ten miles above the junction of the Tippecanoe. It extends
for several miles, and is deposited to the thickness of thirty or
forty feet above the water, forming cliffs which are covered with
alluvial soil and sustain a growth of forest trees. The precise
points of its commencement and disappearance were not observed.
The structure is cellular or vesicular, and resembles, in some
places, a coarse dried mortar. It is very light, and possesses a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
white color in inferior situations, but the surface is somewhat
colored by fallen leaves and other decaying vegetation. It imbeds
fluvatile shells and some vegetable remains, the species of which
have not been ascertained. The opposite, or west side of the
river consists of a kind of puddingstone, or caschalo, made up of
pebbles of quartz, &amp;c., cemented by carbonate of lime, of a yellow
color and translucent. This beautiful aggregate is overlayed by
a stratum, of fifteen or twenty feet in thickness, of diluvial soil.
These localities fall within the limits of the State of Indiana; but
on territories still occupied, if not owned, by the aborigines.</p>

<p>3. <i>Pseudomorphous Carbonate of Lime.</i>&mdash;This form of carbonate
of lime occurs in Pope County, Illinois, a district celebrated for
its fluorspar, lead, crystallized quartz, &amp;c., and bearing the unequivocal
marks of a secondary formation. Scattered in large
masses over the soil, we observe compact limestone, with very
perfect cubical, octahedral, or other regular cavities, which have
manifestly originated from crystals of fluorspar. The most common
<i>impress</i> of this kind appears to have resulted from two cubes
variously joined&mdash;a form of appearance very common to the Illinois
fluates. Some of these cubical cavities exceed three inches
square; but in no case is any remaining portion of the spar in
these cavities, or anywise connected with the fragments of limestone
thus impressed, although, at the same time, the spar is very
abundant in the alluvial soil where these curious limestones are
found.</p>

<p class="subsection">2. Sulphate of Lime.<br />
<span class="sub-subsection">Subs. <i>Gypsum.</i></span></p>

<p>1. <i>Fibrous Gypsum.</i>&mdash;In the alluvial soil of the St. Martin's
Islands, Lake Huron. The fibres are sometimes five or six inches
in length, of a white color and delicate crystalline lustre. Sometimes
these fibrous masses are partially colored yellow or brown,
apparently from the clay, or mixed alluvion, in which they are
imbedded.</p>

<p class="subsection">3. Fluate of Lime.</p>

<p><i>Fluor-Spar.</i>&mdash;On the United States Mineral Reserve, Pope
County, Illinois. This locality is abundant, and the mineral
readily and constantly to be obtained. I first obtained specimens
in June, 1818, and afterwards visited it in July, 1821. It is disseminated
in loose masses throughout the soil, and in veins in the
calcareous rocks. The spot most noted and resorted to, and
where the original discovery was made, is four miles west of Barker's
Ferry, at Cave-in-Rock, on the banks of the Ohio, and about
twenty-six miles, by the course of the river, below Shawneetown.
It is situated in the midst of a hilly, broken region, called <i>the
Knobs</i>, a tract of highlands intervening between the banks of the
Ohio and the Saline. The distance of this range from north to
south, or parallel with the course of the Ohio, cannot be stated.
It probably extends from near the banks of the Wabash River
to the Little Chain of Rocks. Its breadth&mdash;from Barker's Ferry,
west, to Ensminger's, at the Saline, is about twenty miles. It
thus separates, by a rocky border, the prairies of the Illinois from
the current of the Ohio River. These knobs, wherever observed,
bear the indubitable marks of secondary formation, and may be
stated to consist, essentially, of compact limestone resting on sandstone.
The sandstone is sometimes so much colored by iron, and
by globular or irregular masses of iron stone, as to give that rock
a very singular aspect. This may be particularly instanced in
the mural front of the Battery rocks on the banks of the Ohio.
Every part of this formation has more or less the appearance of
a mineral country; and it is already known as the locality of
ores of lead, iron, and zinc, of crystallized quartz, of opal, heavy
spar, crystallized pyrites, and of very perfect fossil madrepores.
In one place (near the head of Hurricane Island) this spar forms
a very large and compact vein, dipping under the bed of the
Ohio. Where the rock has been explored, it is found in connection
with sulphuret of lead, but it has been mostly procured, because
most easy of access, in the alluvial soil. I went out about
half a mile west of the Ohio, where a new locality has been opened,
and, in removing about five or six solid feet of earth, procured as
many specimens as filled a box of fourteen inches square. None
of these were more than two feet below the surface. One of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
specimens is an irregular octahedral crystal, eight inches in diameter.
The color of these masses is various shades of blue, violet,
or red, sometimes perfectly white or yellow; and the form most
commonly assumed is a cube, sometimes truncated at two or more
angles, or variously clustered. The external lustre of the crystals,
raised from alluvial soil, is feeble, but quite brilliant when taken
from veins and cavities in the rock. These spars from the alluvion
do not appear to exist as rock debris, or fragments worn off
from other formations, but as original deposits. There are no
marks of attrition. They appear as much in place as the limestone
rocks below. It should also be recollected that this mineral
tract is terminated by one of the greatest and most valuable salt
formations in the western country&mdash;that of the Illinois Saline.</p>

<p><i>Septaria: Ludus Helmontii.</i>&mdash;This variety of calcareous marl is
found, in orbicular or flattened masses, along the eastern shores of
Lake Michigan, between the rivers St. Joseph's and Kalemazo.
Its original situation appears to be the beds of marly clay which
form the banks of Lake Michigan at these places, from which
these masses have been disengaged by the waves, and left promiscuously
among the washed and eroded debris of the shore.
These masses are penetrated by numerous seams and lines of calcareous
spar, sometimes radiating star-like, or intersecting each
other irregularly. Occasionally, these seams are filled with sulphuret
of zinc, and in these cases the spar, if any be present, is
rose-colored.</p>

<p class="section">d. <span class="large"><i>Aluminous Minerals.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Argillaceous Slate.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Argillite</i>, or <i>Common Argillaceous Slate</i>.&mdash;Along the banks of
the River St. Louis, at the Grand Portage, &amp;c. It occurs in a
vertical position, embracing veins, or subordinate beds, of grauwakke,
milky quartz, chlorite slate, and silicious slate, &amp;c. It is
bounded on one side by red sandstone, and on the other by an
extensive tract of diluvial soil.</p>

<p>2. <i>Bituminous Shale.</i>&mdash;In detached masses, along the shores of
Lake Huron, between Fort Gratiot and Thunder Bay. It contains
amorphous masses of iron pyrites, of a yellow color and
metallic brilliancy, which soon tarnishes on exposure to the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p class="subsection">2. Chlorite.</p>

<p><i>Chlorite Slate.</i>&mdash;In subordinate strata in the argillite of the
River St. Louis.</p>

<p class="subsection">3. Staurotide.</p>

<p>In garnet-colored crystals, in detached blocks of mica-slate, in
the drift of Lake Huron. These crystals consist of two intersecting
six-sided prisms, truncated at both ends, forming the cross.
They are nearly opaque, or feebly translucent on the fractured
edge.</p>

<p class="subsection">4. Clay.</p>

<p>1. <i>Plastic Clay.</i>&mdash;Very extensive beds of this clay are seen
along the west shore of Lake Michigan, between Sturgeon Bay
Portage and Chicago. Its color is generally a light blue, verging
sometimes into deep blue or grayish-white. It is plastic in water,
adheres strongly to the tongue, takes a polish from the nail, and
emits an argillaceous odor when moistened or breathed upon.
These beds of clay frequently contain iron pyrites, both in the
crystallized and amorphous state.</p>

<p>2. <i>Pipe Clay.</i>&mdash;In the flats of the St. Clair and Lake George,
Michigan. A bed of clay, apparently answering to this description,
exists at White River, Lake Michigan. Its color is a grayish-white,
verging to blue. It is very unctuous and adhesive when
first raised, but acquires more or less of a meagre feel as it parts
with its moisture, drying in firm and compact masses.</p>

<p>3. <i>Variegated Clay.</i>&mdash;On the banks of the River St. Peter's,
Upper Mississippi. Neither the quantity in which it exists, nor
the precise locality is known. Its color is white, variegated with
stripes, spots, or clouds of red or yellow.</p>

<p>4. <i>Azure Blue Clay of St. Peter's.</i>&mdash;The locality of this substance,
as communicated by the Indians, is the declivity of a hill, in the
rear of the village of Sessitongs, one mile above the confluence of
the Terre Blue River with the St. Peter's. It is found near the
foot of this hill, between two layers of sandstone rock, in a vein
about fifteen inches in thickness. This vein is elevated about
twenty feet above the waters of the Terre Bleu, and does not extend
far in the direction of the river. Having been resorted to
by the Sioux Indians a long time, a considerable excavation has
been made, but the supply is constant. The color of this mineral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
substance (its distinguishing character) is an azure copper blue of
more or less intensity. It is ductile and moderately adhesive,
when first taken up, or when moistened with water, but acquires
an almost stony solidity on drying. It is considerably adulterated
with sand or particles of quartz. It parts with its moisture rapidly
on exposure to the atmosphere, and dries without much
apparent diminution of volume.</p>

<p>5. <i>Green Clay of St. Peter's.</i>&mdash;This differs little from the preceding,
except in its color, which is a deep or verdigris green, admitting
some diversity of shades. Its composition appears to be,
essentially, alumina, silica, carbonate of copper, water, and iron.</p>

<p>6. <i>Opwagunite</i>; <i>Calamet Stone</i>; <i>Pipe Stone.</i>&mdash;The last of these
terms is a translation of the first, which is Algonquin. Under
these names, a peculiar kind of stone, which is much employed
by the Indians for pipes, has been alluded to by travellers and
geographers from the earliest times. It appears to be a variety
of argillaceous wacke. Its color is most commonly a uniform
dull red, resembling that of red chalk. Sometimes it is spotted
with brown or yellow, but these spots are very minute, and the
colors usually faint. It is perfectly opaque, very compact in its
structure, and possessing that degree of hardness which admits
its being cut or scraped with a knife, or sawed without injury to
a common hand-saw, when first raised from the quarry; but it
acquires hardness by exposure, and even takes a polish. But it is
not capable of receiving a polish by the usual process of rubbing
with grit-stone and pumice, these substances being too harsh for
it. The Indian process is to scrape or file it smooth, and give it
a polish by rubbing with the scouring rush. Its powder is a light
red, and emits an argillaceous odor when wetted. This substance
is procured at the Coteau des Prairie, intermediate between the
sources of the St. Peter's and the Great Sioux Rivers. Some other
places have been mentioned as affording this mineral, particularly
a locality on the waters of Chippewa River; but the mineral procured
here is chocolate-colored.</p>

the Indians in carving pipes.</p>

<p class="subsection">3. Asbestos.</p>

<p><i>Common Asbestos.</i>&mdash;In serpentine and steatite, at Presque Isle
Point, Lake Superior. Also, in minute veins, in detached masses
of diallage and serpentine rocks, on the west shore of Lake Michigan.
These veins are no more than a fourth of an inch in width;
and the fibres of asbestos occur transversely. They are very
flexible, and easily reducible into a flocculent mass.</p>

<p class="section">f. <span class="large"><i>Barytic Minerals.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Sulphate of Barytes.</span></p>

<p><i>Lamellar Sulphate of Barytes.</i>&mdash;In detached masses, imbedded
in diluvial soil, at the mines of Peosta, or Dubuque, on the Upper
Mississippi, where it is accompanied by sulphuret of lead, calcareous
spar, &amp;c. Also, at the Mine au Fevre (now Galena), and
at the mouth of the Sissinaway River, on the east banks of the
Mississippi, between Prairie du Chien and Fort Armstrong. Its
colors are white or yellow, and it is frequently incrusted with a
thin coat of yellow oxide of iron. It is most commonly opaque.
The only translucent specimen seen was procured at Dubuque's
mines.</p>

<p class="section">g. <span class="large"><i>Strontian Minerals.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">Sulphate of Strontian.</span></p>

<p><i>Foliated Sulphate of Strontian.</i>&mdash;At Presque Isle (Wayne's Battle
Ground), on the Maumee River, Wood County, Ohio. It occurs
in veins and cavities, in compact limestone, most commonly in
the form of flattened prisms. Its color is blue, frequently a very
light or sky-blue, and the crystals are fully translucent, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
transparent. In some instances, they appear to have suffered a
partial decomposition, and fall into fragments in the act of raising,
or are covered with a white powdery crust, frequently visible
only on the summits or terminating points of the prisms. The
same limestone yields crystallized calcareous spar. Both these
substances are abundant in the rocky banks and in the bed of
the Maumee. Also, on Grosse Isle, Detroit River, Michigan.</p>

<p class="section">h. <span class="large"><i>Bituminous Minerals.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">1. Bitumen.</span></p>

<p><i>Petroleum.</i>&mdash;Occurs in cavities, in loose fragments of limestone
rock, along the west shore of Lake Michigan, between Milwaukie
and Chicago. These masses of rock lie promiscuously among
fragments of quartz, granite, sandstone, fossil madrepores, &amp;c.,
along the alluvial shore of the lake, and appear to have been
washed up from its bed. The petroleum is in a free and liquid
state; but, where it has suffered an exposure to the atmosphere,
it has acquired a stiff and tar-like consistence passing into <i>maltha</i>.
Not unfrequently, fragments of mineral coal are also found scattered
along these shores, and there is reason to conclude that a
bituminous formation exists in the contiguous inferior strata
forming the basin of the lake.</p>

<p class="subsection">2. Graphite.</p>

<p><i>Granular Graphite.</i>&mdash;In a small vein, in the clay-slate of the
River St. Louis, at the head of the nine-mile portage. It is
coarse-grained and <i>gritty</i>.</p>

<p class="subsection">3. Coal.</p>

<p><i>Slaty Coal.</i>&mdash;The only spot where this mineral has been observed,
in situ, is at La Charbonniére, on the west banks of the
Illinois River, at the computed distance of one hundred and
twenty miles south of the post of Chicago. It is here seen in
horizontal strata, not exceeding two or three inches in thickness,
interposed between layers of sandstone and shale. Breaking out
on the declivity of the bank of the river, where the overlaying
strata are constantly crumbling down, and thus obscuring the
seams, no very satisfactory examination could be made in a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
visit; but the nature and position of the rock strata and soils,
and the general aspect of the country, do not justify the conclusion
that the bed is of much thickness or extent. Valuable beds
may be discovered, however, by exploring this formation. This
coal has a shining black color, a slaty structure, inflames readily,
burning with a bright flame. It is very fragile where exposed to
the weather, falling into fine fragments. Hence, a very black
color has been communicated to the contiguous and overlaying
soil, which is manifestly more or less the result of disintegrated
coal.</p>

<p>Detached fragments of coal, corresponding in mineral characters
with the above, are occasionally found around the southern
shores of Lake Michigan. The inference, as to the existence of
coal around the shores of this lake, is obvious. And we are led
to inquire: Does the La Charbonniére formation of coal exist in
the sandstone and limestone strata forming the table-land between
the Illinois River and Lake Michigan, and reappearing around the
basin of the latter, but at such a depression below its surface as
to elude observation? And, if so, does not this coal formation
extend quite across the southern portion of the peninsula of
Michigan? The secondary character of the region alluded to,
so far as observed, the horizontal and relative position of the
strata, and the general uniformity which is generally observed in
the species and order of the coal measures, favor this suggestion.</p>

<p class="section">i. <span class="large"><i>Soda.</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap">1. Muriate of Soda.</span></p>

<p>No traces of salt are known to have been discovered in those
parts of the territory of the United States situated north of latitude
46° 31´ (which is that of the Sault Ste. Marie) and <i>east</i> of
the Mississippi River. The great secondary formations which
pervade the western country cease south of this general limit,
and with them terminate the salt springs, the gypsum beds, the
coal measures, and other connected minerals which are generally
found in association. It is one of the most important facts which
the science of geology has contributed to the stock of useful information,
that, in the natural order of the rocky and earthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
deposits, muriate of soda always occupies a position contiguous
to that of gypsum. This intimate connection between the sulphate
of lime and the muriate of soda, enables us, by the discovery
of the one, to predict, with considerable but not unerring certainty,
the presence of the other. It adds weight to an observation first
made among the salt formations of Europe, to find its general
correctness corroborated by the relative position of these substances
in the United States. These remarks will apply particularly
to the salt formations of New York, and to some portions
of the muriatiferous region of Virginia and the Arkansas.</p>

<p>There appears to be a salt formation extending from the northwest
angle of the Ohio through Michigan, for a distance of two
hundred to three hundred miles. It commences in the Seweekly
country, passing around the Sandusky River of Lake Erie, where
an extensive bed of granular gypsum has recently been discovered,
and continues, probably, northwest, so as to embrace the Saganaw
basin, and reach quite to the end of the peninsula, and embracing,
perhaps, the Gypsum Islands of Lake Huron, ten miles northeast
of Michilimackinac. All the brine springs and gypsum beds
noticed in the region are situated in the line of this formation.</p>

<p>During the fall of 1821, a number of gentlemen at the Island
of Michilimackinac united in the expenses of a tour for exploring
the Skeboigon River, a stream which originates in the peninsula
of Michigan, and flows into Lake Huron opposite the Island of
Bois Blanc. The particular object of this party was to ascertain
the precise locality of certain salt springs reported to exist upon
that stream. They proceeded to the places indicated, and examined
several springs more or less impregnated with salt, but
reported that, owing to the jealousy and hostility of those bands
of Indians who were found upon that stream, they were not enabled
fully to accomplish the object in view.</p>

<p>There are several salt springs reported to exist near the Indian
village of Wendagon, on the Sciawassa River, and others on the
Titabawassa River, the principal tributaries of the Sagana. Little
is, however, known respecting these springs, but the water is represented
to be so strongly impregnated, that the Indians manufacture
from it all the salt necessary for their villages.</p>

<p>Grand River Valley has also been mentioned among the localities
of salt water and gypsum rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Hints may thus be derived of value to the future commerce
of the country. Scarcely any of the new states are without
indications of the existence of salt. Every day is adding to the
number of localities.</p>

<p>In the region <i>west</i> of the Mississippi, I was informed that salt
occurs, in the crystallized form, in the territories of the Yanktons,
who inhabit the flat country at the sources of the River St. Peter's.
In certain parts of these plains, the salt exists on the surface. It
is mixed with earth, in specimens brought to me, but crystallized
in cubes, very imperfect, of a gray or grayish-white color. The
Indians scrape it up from certain parts of the prairies or plains,
where the salt water is prevented from draining off.</p>

<p class="subsection">2. Alkaline Sulphate of Alumina.</p>

<p>This salt exists, in the form of efflorescences, in the cavities and
fissures of rocks along the southeast parts of the shores of Sagana
Bay, Lake Huron, and in the argillaceous formations at Erie, on
Lake Erie, Pennsylvania.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These positions embrace the principal localities of minerals
noticed. In travelling rapidly through a remote wilderness, there
was but little opportunity to explore off the track; and the whole
observation was confined to the mere surface of the country, which
is much obscured by diluvial and alluvial formations.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the region of Lake Superior has been a
fruitful field for mineralogical inquiry, and it is one which invites
further exploration. Its mineralogy affords a variety of interesting
substances which are objects of scientific research, and it may
be anticipated to be the future theatre of extensive mining operations.
The country northwest of Lake Superior, and the Upper
Mississippi north of the Falls of St. Anthony&mdash;consisting mostly
of upheaved primitive rocks and the pebble-drift, or diluvial, formations&mdash;has
furnished but few subjects of mineralogical remark.</p>

<p>The district of country between the Falls of St. Anthony and
Prairie du Chien, in common with the more southern portions of
the Mississippi Valley, partakes of all the interest which the
mineral kingdom presents in a calcareous and metalliferous country
of secondary formation. It has added considerably to my collection.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
It is probable the Rivers St. Peter's, St. Croix, and Chippeway
would well reward exploration; but the mines of Dubuque
particularly invite a mineralogical survey. Their future importance
cannot fail to be duly appreciated.</p>

<p>If the country has put on an aspect unfavorable to mineralogy,
its geological features have been observed to sustain its interest.</p>

<p>Much of the interest growing out of the examination, for the
first time, of the mineralogy and natural history of the country,
is such as to commend itself, in an especial manner, to the consideration
of men of science, and of associations devoted to scientific
details, rather than the department of a government. To
these former, nature is a storehouse of facts, and a perpetual
anxiety is felt by this class of observers to know the range, not
only of our rock formations, but of our plants, shells, fossils, and
other classes of objects in our physical geography. Such desires
I have endeavored, as far as my means permitted, to gratify.
The fresh-water conchology of the lakes and rivers visited was
often attractive, when other objects excited little interest. The
species collected in this department have been referred to the
New York Lyceum of Natural History.</p>

<p>With these remarks, the result of an arduous and interesting
journey through a part of the continent hitherto unexplored, I
have the honor to conclude my report, and to terminate the trust
confided to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> In reply to the inquiries, contained in a resolution of the
Senate of the United States, respecting the existence of copper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
mines in the region of Lake Superior, inclosed to me in a note
from the War Department, dated 8th May, 1822, I have the honor
to submit to you the following facts and remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In relation to "<i>the number, value, and position of the copper
mines on the south shore of Lake Superior</i>." The remote position
of the country alluded to, the infrequency of communication, and
the little reliance to be placed on information derived through
the medium of the aborigines or of traders, who are wholly engrossed
with other objects, presents an embarrassment at the
threshold of this inquiry, which must be felt by every person who
turns his attention to the subject. The information sought for
demands a minute acquaintance with the natural features and
mineral structure of the country, which can only be acquired by
personal examination; and it is a species of research requiring
more leisure, better opportunities, and a freer participation in
personal fatigue, than usually falls to the share of tourists and
travellers. Not only are those difficulties to be encountered which
are inseparable from the collection of isolated facts in a new and
unsettled country, but those, also, which are peculiar to the subject,
connected as it is, at every stage of the inquiry, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
prejudices and superstitions of the Indian tribes. [B.] It can,
therefore, excite little surprise that, after having been the theme
of speculation for more than a century, and obtained the notice
of several works of merit in Europe,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[236]</a> both the position and value
of these mineral beds have continued to the present times to be
but partially known. To ascertain more clearly their value and
importance to the Republic were objects more particularly confided
to me as a member of the expedition sent by the Indian
Department, in the year 1820, to traverse and explore those regions.
My report of the 6th of November of that year&mdash;a copy
of which, marked A, is herewith transmitted&mdash;gives the result of
that inquiry. After a lapse of two years, little can be added.
Reflection and subsequent inquiry convince me that the facts advanced
in that report will be corroborated by future observation.
No circumstance has transpired which is calculated to prove that
my suggestions with regard to the fertility and future importance
of those mines are fallacious; on the contrary, all information
tends to strengthen and confirm those suggestions. Specimens
of pure and malleable copper continue to be brought in to me
by the aborigines from that region, but it is not deemed necessary
to particularize in this place the additional localities. It will be
sufficient to observe, that the number of these new discoveries
justifies the expectations that have been created respecting the
metalliferous character of the region of the Ontonagon, and the
south shore of Lake Superior. [C.]</p>

<p>I shall here add the result of an accurate analysis made upon
a specimen of this copper at the mint of Utrecht, in the Netherlands,
at the request of Mr. Eustis, minister plenipotentiary from
the United States, who carried samples of the American copper
to that country. The report of the inspector of the mint, which
communicates the result of this analysis, has the following remarks
upon the natural properties of this species of copper, and the
mode of its production: "From every appearance, the piece of
copper seems to have been taken from a mass that has undergone
fusion. The melting was, however, not an operation of art, but
a natural effect caused by a volcanic eruption. The stream of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
lava probably carried along in its course the aforesaid body of
copper, that had formed into one collection, as fast as it was heated
enough to run, from all parts of the mine. The united mass was
probably borne in this manner to the place where it now rests in
the soil. The crystallized form, observable everywhere on the
original surface of the metal that has been left untouched or undisturbed,
leads me to presume that the fusion it has sustained
was by a process of nature; since this crystallized surface can
only be supposed to have been produced by a slow and gradual
cooling, whereby the copper assumed regular figures as its heat
passed into other substances, and the metal itself lay exposed to
the air.</p>

<p>"As to the properties of the copper itself, it may be observed
that its color is a clear red; that it is peculiarly qualified for rolling
and forging; and that its excellence is indicated by its resemblance
to the copper usually employed by the English for
plating. The dealers in copper call this sort <i>Peruvian copper</i> to
distinguish it from that of <i>Sweden</i>, which is much less malleable.
The specimen under consideration is incomparably better than
Swedish copper, as well on account of its brilliant color as for the
fineness of its pores and its extreme ductility. Notwithstanding,
before it is used in manufactures, or for the coining of money, it
ought to be melted anew, for the purpose of purifying it from
such earthy particles as it may contain. The examination of the
North American copper, in the sample received from his excellency
the minister, by the operation of the cupel and test by fire,
has proved that it does not contain the smallest particle of silver,
gold, or any other metal." It is a coincidence worthy of remark,
that the suggestions offered by the assayer respecting the volcanic
origin of these masses of copper, are justified by the leading features
of the Porcupine Mountains, and by the melted granites
found upon the heights called Grande Sables and Ishpotonga.</p>

<p>2. The second and third inquiries of the resolution relate to
"<i>the names of the Indian tribes who claim the mines, and the practicability
of extinguishing their title</i>." By the treaty concluded at
this post on the 16th of June, 1820, the Ojibwai<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[237]</a> Indians cede
to the United States four miles square of territory, bounded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the River St. Mary's, and including the portage around the falls.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[238]</a>
This is the most northerly point to which the Indian title has
been extinguished in the United States. The different bands of
Ojibwais possess all the country northwest of this post, extending
through Lake Superior to the sources of the Mississippi,
where they are bounded by the Assennaboins, the Crees, and the
Chippewyans of the Hudson Bay colony. Their lands extend
down the Mississippi to the Sioux boundary, an unsettled line
between the junction of the River De Corbeau and the Falls of St.
Anthony. South of Lake Superior, they claim to the possessions
of the Winnebagoes, on the Ouisconsin and Fox Rivers, and to
those of the Pottawatamies and Ottoways, on Lake Michigan.
The Wild Rice, or Monomonee Indians, are an integral part of
the Ojibwai nation, deriving their name from the great reliance
they place on the zizania aquatica as an article of food. They
live in small, dispersed bands between the Ojibwais of the lake,
and the Winnebagoes of Fox River. Those residing among the
Ojibwais speak the same language, but with many peculiarities
and corruptions on the waters of Green Bay. They claim the
respective tracts upon which they are located. These are, principally,
the valleys of the Fox and Monomonee Rivers, and the
rice lands contiguous to the Fol. Avoine, Clam Lake, and Lac de
Flambeau, which lie on the table-lands between Lake Superior
and the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The right of soil to all that part of the Peninsula of Michigan
not purchased by the United States is divided between the Ojibwais
and the Ottoways. The former claim all the shores and
islands of Lake Huron situated north of the Saganaw purchase,
except those in the vicinity of Michilimackinac and the St. Martin,
or Gypsum Islands, which were ceded by treaty on the 6th of
July, 1820.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[239]</a> Their territories continue north, through the River
St. Mary's, embracing the country on both banks, and the islands
in the river, saving Drummond's Island, which is garrisoned by
the British, and the Four Mile concession at the Sault or Falls,
now occupied by a detachment of the United States' army. It is
not deemed necessary to point out the limits of their territories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
with more precision, or to pursue them into the Canadas, where
they are also very extensive. It will sufficiently appear, from
this outline, that the discoveries of copper on the south shore of
Lake Superior are upon their lands. That some of these discoveries
have been made upon, or will be traced to, the possessions
of the North Monomonees, is also probable.</p>

<p>With respect to the practicability of extinguishing the Indian
title, no difficulty is to be apprehended. Living in small villages,
or tribes of the same mark, scattered over an immense territory,
and often reduced to great poverty by the failure of game and
fish, it is presumed there would be a disposition among their chiefs
and head men to dispose of portions of it. Those districts which
most abound in minerals, presenting a rough and rocky surface,
are the least valuable to them as hunting-grounds; and the goods
and annuities which they would receive in exchange must be
vastly more important to them than any game which these mineral
lands now afford.</p>

<p>3. "<i>The probable advantage which may result to the Republic from
the acquisition and working of these mines.</i>" How far metallic
mines, situated upon the public domain, may be considered as a
source of national wealth, and what system of management is best
calculated to produce the greatest advantages to the public revenue,
are inquiries which are not conceived to be presented for
consideration in this place; nor should I presume to offer any
speculations upon topics which have been so often discussed, and
so fully settled. In applying axioms, however, to a species of
productive industry, the results of which are so very various
under various situations, great caution is undoubtedly necessary;
and it must appear manifest, on the slightest reflection, how much
the comparative value of metallic mines, equally fertile and productive,
ever depends upon situation and local advantages. Dismissing,
therefore, all questions of abstract policy, I shall here
adduce a few facts in relation to the fertility of these mineral
beds, and their position with respect to a market&mdash;points upon
which their value to the nation must ultimately turn.</p>

<p>That copper is abundantly found on the south shore of Lake
Superior has been shown. It is unnecessary here to add to, or
repeat the instances of its occurrence, or to urge, from an inspection
of the surface, the fertility of subterranean beds. All the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
facts which I possess in relation to this subject are before you,
and you will assign to them such importance as they merit. It
is a subject upon which I have bestowed some reflection and
much inquiry, superadded to limited opportunities of personal
observation, and the result has led me to form a favorable estimate
of their value and importance. It is not only certain that a
prodigious number of masses of metallic copper are found along
the borders of the lake, but every appearance authorizes a conclusion
that they are only the indications of near and continuous
veins. Some of these masses are of unexampled size, and all
present metallic copper in a state of great purity and fineness.
Of its ductile and excellent qualities for the purposes of coinage
and sheathing, the analysis of Utrecht leaves no doubt. It is
true that a mistaken idea has prevailed among travellers and
geographers respecting the weight of the great mass of copper on
the Ontonagon River; but it is, nevertheless, of extraordinary
dimensions, and I have endeavored to show, from their works,
how these errors have originated, and that the metal is disseminated
throughout a much greater extent of country, and in masses
of every possible form and size. Until my facts and data can,
therefore, be proved to be fallacious, I must be permitted to consider
these mines not only fertile in native copper and its congenerous
species, but unparalleled in extent, and to recommend
them as such to the notice of the Government.</p>

<p>But, whatever degree of incertitude may exist respecting the
riches of these mines, their situation with respect to a market can
admit of no dispute. As little can there be concerning the advantages
which this situation presents for the purposes of mining
and commerce. Let us compare it with that of other mines, and
appeal to acknowledged facts for the decision. The value of a
coal mine, a stone quarry, or a gypsum bed, often arises as much
from its situation as its fertility. But the proposition may be
reversed with respect to a metallic mine, the value of which to
the proprietor arises more from its fertility and less from its situation.
Gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, &amp;c., when separated from the
matrix of the mine, are so valuable that they can bear to be transported
a long journey over land, and the most distant voyage
by water. Their worth in coined money, produce, or manufactures,
is not fixed in the particular circles of country where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
are dug up, but depends upon the seaboard market, and embraces
all countries. The silver of Mexico and Peru circulates throughout
Europe, and is carried to China. It is no objection to those
mines that they are situated in the Cordilleras, or upon the high
table-lands of the American continent, and must be carried a
thousand miles upon the backs of mules to the seaside. The
very discovery of those mines has rendered many poor silver
mines of Europe of no value, although possibly situated in the
environs of the best silver markets in the world. It is the fertility,
and not the situation of such mines, that constitutes their
chief value; and it is so with many of the coarser metals.</p>

<p>The tin of the Island of Banka, and the Peninsula of Siam in
Asia, and the copper of Japan, find their way to Europe, and are
articles of commerce in the United States. The cobalt of Saxony
is sent to Pekin, and the platina of Choco, to all parts of the
world. In all these instances, the fertility of the mines compensates
for every disadvantage of situation. But this principle is
not alone confined to mines of tin, copper, &amp;c.; it even holds true
of the heavy and bulky articles of iron, lead, and salt. The lead
of Missouri finds a market at New York, Philadelphia, and Boston,
and will be carried to Europe. It is no objection that it
must be conveyed in wagons forty miles from the interior, and
sent a voyage of 3,000 miles in steamboats and merchant ships.
The great fertility of the mines counterbalances the disadvantages
of its remote position from the market, and it is the price of the
metal in the market which always regulates its price at the mines.
The malleable iron of Sweden is consumed on the summits of the
Alleghany, although its strata are replete with iron ore, which is
worked at numerous forges along the rivers which proceed from
each side of it. It is believed that the salt springs of Onondaga,
from their copiousness alone, would supply a vast portion of the
interior and seaboard of the United States with salt, even if the
facilities of water carriage had not been presented by the Erie
Canal. The value of such mines and minerals ever depends as
much upon the abundance as upon the favorable position of them.
It is far otherwise with quarries of stone, gypsum, marl, fossil
coal, &amp;c., whose contiguity to a good market establishes their
value. No abundance of these articles would justify a land carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of one hundred miles. They constitute a species of mining,
the profits and value of which increases in the ratio of the surrounding
population, and as the country advances in improvements.
But this advantage is far less sensibly felt, and cannot
be considered essential to the successful working of mines of
silver, copper, &amp;c. Neither the remote position, therefore, of the
Lake Superior copper mines, nor the want of a surrounding population,
present objections of that force which would at first seem
to exist; and it is confidently believed that, if their fertility is
such as facts indicate, they may be opened and wrought with
eminent advantage to the Republic. But let us examine their
situation with respect to a market, and compare it with that of
other mines of the same metal, and of some of the coarser metals,
which bear a considerable land, and the most distant water carriage.
To favor the inquiry, let it be granted for the moment
that proximity of situation to a market, or free water carriage,
are indispensable to the success and value of the most fertile
mines.</p>

<p>Assuming the confluence of the Ontonagon River with Lake
Superior (which is apparently the centre of the mine district) as
the place where the metal is first to be embarked for market, it
must be carried down the lake 300 miles to the Sault or rapids
of St. Mary's. Here, if it is in barges, it may descend the rapids
in perfect safety, as is the invariable practice of the traders on
arriving with their annual returns of furs and skins from the
north. If in vessels, it must be transferred either into boats or
carts, and carried half a mile to the foot of the rapids, where it
will again be embarked in vessels, and transported through the
Lakes Huron, St. Clair, and Erie, and their connecting straits, to
Buffalo, a distance of 650 miles. The progress made in the construction
of the great canal which is to connect the lakes and
Atlantic, is such as to leave no doubt upon any reasonable mind
of the full completion of that work with the close of the year
1824. Through this channel, the transportation is to be continued
in boats or barges, by a voyage of 353 miles, to the Hudson at
Albany; thence a sloop navigation of 144 miles, which, for speed
and freedom from risk, is perhaps unequalled in all America,
takes it into the harbor of New York, making the entire distance,
from the mouth of the Ontonagon, 1,447 miles. From New York
it is distributed to our naval depots, and to the markets of Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
It is exchanged for the lead of Missouri, the iron of Sweden, or
the silver of Mexico; and the same ready communication transports
the return cargo to Buffalo, from whence the commerce is
extended, by means of the lakes, throughout western New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and the interminable
regions of the north. Thus it is seen that, when the Erie
Canal is completed, a free and direct water communication, from
the mines to one of the best markets in America, will exist, in
which the rapids of St. Mary's are the only interruption, and this
is only an interruption to large vessels. Not only so, but the
Ontonagon River may be ascended many miles with vessels of
light burden, and thus the copper of Lake Superior, wafted from
the heart of the interior, and from the base of the Porcupine
Mountains, into the harbors of New York, Philadelphia, &amp;c. Of
this whole distance, 1,047 miles are now navigated by the largest
class of river craft and lake schooners; the balance of the distance
is the length of the Erie Canal. (See <a href="#D">Note D.</a>)</p>

<p>Let it be recollected that there are no mines of copper situated
upon the margin of the sea, and that every quintal of sheet copper,
bolts, nails, &amp;c., which we receive from Great Britain, Russia,
Sweden, or Japan, is transported a greater or less distance on
turnpikes or canals, before it reaches the place of shipment. The
richest copper mines of the Russian empire are seated on the
summits of the Uralian Mountains; those of Fahlun, in Sweden,
and Cornwall, in England, are scarcely more favored as to position;
and, owing to a want of coal, all the ores raised at the latter
are transported into Wales to be smelted.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[240]</a> But we need not
resort to Europe for instances. All the lead raised at the fertile
mines in Missouri is transported an average distance of forty
miles in carts and wagons before it reaches the banks of the Mississippi.
Steamboats take it to New Orleans, a distance, by the
shortest computation, of 1,000 miles. But it must still pass
through the Gulf of Mexico, and encounter the perils of the Capes
of Florida, and a voyage of 2,000 miles along the coast of the
United States, before it reaches its principal marts. The average
cost of transporting a hundredweight of lead from Mine au Breton
and Potosi to the banks of the Mississippi, during the year 1818,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
was seventy-five cents. The distance is thirty-six miles. The
price of conveying the same quantity from the storehouses at
Herculaneum and St. Genevieve to New Orleans, by steamboats,
was seventy cents. The distance exceeds 1,000 miles. Hence,
it costs more to transport a given quantity thirty-six miles by
land than to convey it 1,000 by water. These rates have probably
varied since, but the proportionate expense of land carriage,
compared to that of water, will remain the same. A quintal of
copper may, therefore, be transported from the mines of Superior
to Buffalo or Lockport, in New York, for the same sum required
to convey an equal quantity of lead from Potosi to St. Genevieve.
If we consider the city of New York as the market of both, no
hesitancy or doubt can be experienced as to the decided and palpable
advantages possessed by the northern mines. It is only
necessary to adduce these facts; the conclusions are inevitable.
In every point of view, the distance of these mines from the market
presents no solid objection to their being explored with profit
to the nation.</p>

<p>Pig copper, which is the least valuable form in which this metal
is carried to market, is now quoted in the Atlantic cities at 19
cents per pound; sheathing, at 27; brazier's, at 32. I have no
data at hand to show the amount of these articles consumed in
the United States, and for which we are annually transmitting
immense sums to enrich foreign States. But those who best appreciate
the advantages of commerce will readily supply the estimate.
It would be an interesting inquiry to ascertain how much
of the sums yearly paid for sheathing copper, bolts, nails, engravers'
plates, &amp;c., is contributed to the wealth of the respective
foreign States who possess mines of this metal. We can look
back to a period in the history of Great Britain, when that power
did not contribute one pound of copper to the commerce of Europe.
During a period of nine years, closing with the memorable
year (in American history) of 1775, the produce of the copper
mines of Cornwall was 2,650 tons of fine copper. (See <a href="#E">Note E.</a>)
Since that time, the yearly returns of those mines exhibit a constant
increase; and the copper mines of Great Britain are now
the most valuable in the world. The amount produced by the
mines of Cornwall and Devon, after deducting the charges of
smelting, for the single year of 1810, was 969,376 pounds sterling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
(See <a href="#F">Note F.</a>) The clear profits of the Dolgoath mine, one of the
richest in Cornwall, for a period of five months, during the year
1805, was £18,000, which is at the rate of £43,200, or $192,000,
per annum. Next to Great Britain, the most considerable mines
of Europe are those of Russia, Austria, Sweden, and Westphalia,
as it was in 1808. Of less importance are those of Denmark,
France, Saxony, Prussia, and Spain. The proportion in which
the British mines exceed those of the most favored European
nation is as 200,000 x 67,000. (See <a href="#G">Note G.</a>)</p>

<p>There is another consideration connected with this subject
which is worthy of remark. Should it be inquired what would
be the effects of the purchase of these mines upon the condition
of the Indian tribes, the reply is obvious. It would have the
most beneficial tendency. They would not only profit by an exchange
of their waste lands for goods, implements of husbandry,
the stipulated services of blacksmiths, teachers, &amp;c., but the intercourse
would have a happy tendency to allay those bitter feelings
which, through the instigation of the British authorities in the
Canadas, they have manifested, and still continue to feel, in degree,
towards the United States. The measures which the President
has recently directed to be pursued to assuage these feelings of
hostility, and to induce them to cherish proper sentiments of
friendship and respect, are already in a train of execution that
bids fair for success. Continued exertions, and the necessary and
proper means, are all that seem necessary to confirm and complete
the effect; and whatever measures have a tendency to increase
the intercourse of American citizens with these "remote
tribes," and to give them a true conception of the power and justice,
and the pacific and benevolent policy of our Government,
must favor and hasten such a result.</p>

<p>Among the numerous superstitions which the Indian tribes
entertain, that respecting mines is not the least remarkable. They
are firmly impressed with a belief that any information communicated
to the whites, disclosing the position of mines or metallic
treasures situated upon their grounds, is displeasing to their
manitos, and even to the Great Spirit himself, from whom they
profess to derive every good and valuable gift; and that this
offence never fails to be visited upon them in the loss of property,
in the want of success in their customary pursuits or pastimes,
in untimely death, or some other singular disaster or untoward
event. This opinion, although certainly not a strange one to be
cherished by a barbarous people, is, nevertheless, believed to have
had its origin in the transactions of an era which is not only very
well defined, but must ever remain conspicuous in the history of
the discovery and settlement of America. It is very well known
that the precious metals were the principal objects which led the
Spanish invaders to penetrate into the interior of Mexico and
Peru, and ultimately to devastate and conquer the country, to
plunder and destroy its temples, and to tax and enslave its ill-fated
inhabitants. It is equally certain that, to escape these scenes
of cruelty and oppression, many tribes and fragments of tribes,
when further resistance became hopeless, fled towards the north,
preferring the enjoyment of liberty and tranquillity upon the chilly
borders of the northern lakes, to the pains of servitude in the
mild and delightful valleys of Mexico, and the golden plains of
the Incas. In this way, many tribes who originally migrated
from the north, along the Pacific Ocean, to the Gulf of California,
and thence over all New Spain, were returned towards the north
over the plains of Texas and the valley of the Mississippi; those
tribes nearest the scenes of the greatest atrocities always pressing
upon the remoter and less civilized, who, in turn, pressed upon
the nations less enlightened than themselves, and finally drove
them into the unfrequented forests of the north. Among these
terrified tribes, the traditions of the Ojibwais affirm that their
ancestors came, and that they originally dwelt in a country destitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
of snows. Many tribes who now speak idioms of their
language were left upon the way, and have since taken distinctive
names. Among these, are the Pottawatamies, the Ottoways, &amp;c.
The latter formerly were, as they still remain, the agriculturists.
The Miamis and Shawnees, whose languages bear some affinity,
preceded them in their flight. The Winnebagoes, speaking a
separate and original tongue, came later, and preserve more
distinct traditions of their migration. All these tribes carried
with them the strong prejudices and fixed hatred excited by the
cruelty, rapacity, and cupidity of their European conquerors; and,
above all, of that insatiable thirst for gold and silver which led the
Spaniards to sack their towns, burn their temples, and torture
their people. Cruelty and injustice of so glaring a character must
have made upon their minds too deep an impression ever to be
forgotten, or completely erased from their traditions. To that
memorable epoch we must, therefore, look for the origin of that
cautious and distrustful disposition which these tribes have since
manifested with regard to the mines and minerals situated upon
their lands; and the circumstance seems to offer an abundant
excuse, if not a justification, for those prevarications and evasions
which present a continual series of embarrassment to every person
who seeks through their aid to develop the mineral resources, or
describe the natural productions, of their territories. Hence, too,
the cause why they are prone to imagine that all mineral or
metallic substances obtained or sought upon their lands, are susceptible
of being converted or <i>transmuted</i> into the precious metals.</p>

<p class="subsection">(C.)</p>

<p>The following <i>additional</i> localities of native copper, derived
from sources entitled to respect, and accompanied, in some instances,
by specimens of the metal, may here be given:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Grand Menou, or Isle Royal, Lake Superior. Captain&mdash;&mdash;,
of the schooner&mdash;&mdash;, in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company,
on Lake Superior, describes this island as affording frequent
masses of copper. While becalmed off its shores in the spring of
1822, and, afterwards, in coasting along the island for a distance
of one hundred miles, his men frequently went ashore, and never
failed to bring back with them lumps of metallic copper, which
they found promiscuously scattered among the fragments of rock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
These were more abundant in approaching its southwestern extremity,
where they unite in representing it to exist in a solid
vein. Specimens of limpid quartz, chalcedony, and striped agate,
were also brought to me from this island. [J. S. J. J.]</p>

<p>2. On the extremity of the great peninsula, called by the natives
Meenaiewong, or Keweena Point, which forms so prominent
a feature in the physiognomy of Lake Superior. It occurs in the
detached form. [J. H. J. J.]</p>

<p>3. At Point aux Beignes, which is the east cape of the entrance
into L'Ance Quewiwenon. A mass from this place was raised
from the sandstone rock, which predominates there. [J. Y. B.]</p>

<p>4. At Caug Wudjieu, or the Porcupine Mountains, Lake Superior;
in masses, enveloped with a green crust, along the banks
of the Carp, or Neemaibee River, which originates in these
mountains. [W. M. G. Y. J. J.]</p>

<p>5. On the banks of Lac Courterroile. This lake lies near the
source of the River Broule, or Cawesacotai, which enters Lake
Superior near La Pointe. It occurs in the alluvial soil, which is
a kind of loamy earth, with pebbles intermixed, but of a rich
quality, and timbered with beech and maple. It is found mostly
in small, flat masses, more or less oxidated. [B. G. J. G. Y.]</p>

<p>6. In a vein on the shore of Lake Superior, between La Riviere
de Mort and St. John's, a little to the west of Presque Isle. [J. J.]</p>

<p>7. On the northeast branch of the Ontonagon River. [J. H.]</p>

<p>8. In the precipitous bluffs called Le Portail, and the Pictured
Rocks. A green matter oozes from the seams in these rocks,
and forms a kind of stalactites, which is apparently a carbonate
of copper. [G. Y.]</p>

<p>These localities embrace a range of more than two hundred
miles along the south shore of Lake Superior, which proves how
intimately this metal and its ores are identified with the rocks
and the soil of that region.</p>

<p class="subsection"><a name="D" id="D"></a>(D.)</p>

<p>In all our calculations respecting the position and advantages
of these mines, too much stress cannot be laid upon the facilities
of the lake navigation. It is believed that a ton of merchandise,
or a barrel bulk, can be transported through the lakes at the
same rates that are paid in the coasting trade of the United States.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Nor is the risk greater. The best data which I can command,
induce me to conclude that a quintal of copper can be conveyed
from the place of shipment on Lake Superior, to the city of New
York, for <i>one dollar</i>. The present price of transportation, for a
barrel bulk, from Buffalo to Mackina, may be stated, on the
average of freights, at 8<i>s.</i>, New York. The mean weight of a
barrel bulk, taking flour as the standard, may be safely put down
at 200 lbs. gross, being 50 cents per cwt. But it must be recollected
that there is no return freight; and, consequently, that this
sum covers the expenses not only of the outward and return
voyage, but still leaves a profit to the owner. Messrs. Gray and
Griswold, sutlers of the 2d regiment, paid 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, New York, per
barrel bulk, from Buffalo to the Sault. This gives a result of 59
cents per cwt. But, if a return cargo could be obtained, one-half
of this sum would afford an equal profit on the voyage; and it
is believed that the article of bar copper could at all times be
conveyed from the Sault to Buffalo for 20 cents per cwt. Being
a very convenient species of ballast, it would oftentimes be taken
in lieu of stone, and, consequently, cost no greater sum than the
price of carrying it on board. But the facilities and cheapness
of the lake navigation cannot, perhaps, be better illustrated than
by stating the price of provisions at the post of St. Mary's, every
article of which is carried from 300 to 700 miles through the
lakes. The following statement of the assistant commissary has
been politely furnished at my request:&mdash;</p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Sault Ste. Marie</span>, October, 1822.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span> Agreeably to your request, I send you a statement
of the actual cost of subsistence stores furnished at this post for
the use of troops at present making the military establishment,
ordered by the Government to this place.</p>

<p>The prices of the several articles below enumerated are at a
small advance on the stores of the settlers outside of the cantonment.</p>

<p>The expenses of subsisting, or rather of maintaining, a garrison
at this place will be as small, if not less, per annum, than at any
other frontier post in our country. The provisions for the soldier
cost as little, I believe, as at any other post, and next year
we shall be able to raise all the forage for the use of our beef

<p class="subsection">(H.)</p>

<p>I shall here give the synonoma for this tribe of Indians,
which appears to have been first recognized by the United States
as an independent tribe by Wayne's treaty of 1795,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[241]</a> under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
name of Chipewa. This name has been retained in all subsequent
treaties with them, not, however, without some discrepance
in the orthography. These variations are chiefly marked by the
introduction of the letter <i>p</i> at the beginning of the second syllable,
or the vowel <i>y</i> annexed to the third; producing Chip-<i>pe</i>-wa,
Chip-<i>pe</i>-wa<i>y</i>, and Chip-e-<i>way</i>. The French missionaries and
traders, whose policy it was to discard the names of the aboriginal
tribes from their conversations, bestowed upon this tribe, at a
very early period, the <i>nom de guerre</i> of <i>Saulteurs</i>, or <i>Sauteurs</i>, from
the Sault or Falls of St. Mary's, which was the ancient seat of
this tribe&mdash;a name which is still retained by the Canadians, and
by many of the American traders. Among the early French
writers, they were also sometimes denominated <i>Outchipouas</i>.
There is as little uniformity among travellers and geographers.
Pinkerton, Darby, Morse, Carver, Mackenzie, and Herriot, either
employ the word according to the orthography of Wayne's treaty,
or with the modifications above noticed. The name of Chippewyans,
employed by Mackenzie, relates to a tribe residing north
and west of the sources of the Mississippi, who speak a language
having no affinity, and are a distinct people. Henry, who was
well versed in the Chippewa language, also conforms to the
popular usage, but observes that the true name, as pronounced
by themselves, is Ojibwa.</p>

<p>Having taken pains to ascertain and fix the pronunciation of
this word, I have not hesitated to introduce it into my correspondence
and official accounts; but I am aware of my great
temerity in so doing. Popular prejudices, and several of the
authorities above cited, stand opposed to the proposed innovation.
The continued use of the word "Chippewa" is also sanctioned by
a name entitled to conclusive respect. "I write the word in this
way," observes the Executive of Michigan, "because I am apprehensive
the orthography is inveterately fixed, and not because I
suppose it is correct." Still, there are reasons for changing it.
Justice to this unfortunate race requires it. Since the popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
apathy to their condition is such that every remembrance of their
actual customs, manners, and traditions will probably perish with
them, and their <i>name</i>, ere long, be all that is left, it is at least incumbent
upon us to transmit <i>that</i> to posterity in its true sound&mdash;as
the fathers and sachems pronounced it. If, then, there is an
acknowledged error in this respect, shall we hesitate to correct it?</p>

<h4>IX.<br />
<span class="subheader"><i>Rapid Glances at the Geology of Western New York, west of the
Rome Summit, in 1820.</i></span><a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[242]</a></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock Formations.</span>&mdash;1. Assuming the area of the most eastwardly
head of the Onondaga Valley, the Wood Creek, and the
Rome Summit, and the valley of the Niagara, with an indefinite
extent laterally, to form the limits of this inquiry; it is in coincidence
with all known facts to say that it is a secondary region,
consisting of the sedimentary and semi-crystalline strata, the lines
of which are perfectly horizontal. Colored sandstone, generally
red, forms the lowest observed stratum.</p>

<p>Wherever streams have worn deep channels, they either disclose
this rock or its adjuncts, the grits, or silicious sinter. It is
apparent in the chasm at Niagara Falls, about half a mile below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the cataract. It is often seen on the surface of the country, or
buried slightly beneath the soil. In color, hardness, and other
characters, there is a manifest variety. But, considered as a
"formation," no doubt can exist of its unity. Its thickness can
only be conjectured, as no labor has, so far as we know, penetrated
through it.</p>

<p>Judging from observations made in Cattaraugus County, in
1818, the coal measures have been completely swept from this area.</p>

<p>2. Next in point of altitude, is the series of dark, carbonaceous,
shelly slate rock. The thickness of this formation, as indicated
at Niagara, cannot be less than ninety feet. It is also often a
surface-rock in the district, forming portions of the banks of lakes,
streams, &amp;c. It is characterized by organic remains of nascent
species. Portions of it also disclose rounded masses of pre-existing
rocks.</p>

<p>3. Last in the order of superposition, is the secondary limestone
formation. It is, most commonly, of a dark, sedimentary aspect.
It is not invariably so, but portions of it have a shining, semi-crystalline
fracture. Shades of color also vary considerably, but
it never, in the scale of colors, exceeds a whitish-gray. Viewed
at different localities, the mass is either compact, fetid, shelly, or
silicious. Much of it produces good quicklime. It is often rendered
"bastard," as the phrase is, by argillaceous and earthy impurities.
Organic impressions, and remains of sea shells and
coarse corals are frequent. Encrinites give some portions of it
the appearance of eyed or dotted secondary marble. The occurrence
of a hard variety of hornstone, which is not flint, is apparently
confined to the compact, fetid variety. This formation,
like the two preceding, may be found to consist of separate strata.
Localities, joining, overlaying, substrata, mineral contents, organic
species, &amp;c., require observation. The following notices are
added.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Changes.</span>&mdash;The evidences which are furnished of
ancient submersion, which has "changed and overturned" vast
portions of the solid land, are neither few nor equivocal. They
are seen as well in the rock strata as the alluvial soils. The most
elevated hills and the lowest valleys are equally productive of the
evidences of extensive changes. The whole aspect of the country
seems to attest to the ancient dominion of water. But the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
striking proof of its agency is, perhaps, found in the sea-shells,
polypi, and crustacea, which are preserved, in their outlines, in
solid strata. Some of these are most vivid in their shapes and
ray-like markings, particularly the univalve shells.</p>

<p>A subsequent change, in the surface of the country, is indicated
by the marks of attrition and watery action upon the faces of these
rocks, in situations greatly elevated above the present water-levels.
This action must, consequently, be referred to a period when extensive
submersions, in the nature of lakes or semi-seas, existed;
for there is no power in present lakes and streams, however
swelled and reinforced by rains or melting snows, to reach even
a moiety of the elevation of these ancient water-marks. It is to
the era of these last submersions that we are encouraged, by evidences,
to look, as the disturbing cause which has buried trees,
leaves, and bones in alluvial soils.</p>

<p><i>Action of Water.</i>&mdash;In examining some portions of the flat
lands of Ontario County, such as the township of Phelps, there
are strata of a fine sedimentary soil, such as might be expected
to result from the settlings of water not greatly agitated. The
bottoms of mill-ponds afford an analogous species of soil. In
these level districts, there are also not unfrequently observed
fields of bare flat rock, of the limestone species, which is checkered
in its surface, conveying the idea of their having formed a flooring
to some former lake. An appearance of this kind may be seen
a few hundred yards from the meeting-house in Phelps. The
rock, in this instance, is a carbonate of lime, and affords organic
remains.</p>

<p>The Oak Openings, in Erie County, are a kind of natural meadows
or prairies. Many suppose them to have been ancient
clearings; but of this the Indians have no tradition, and the evidences
of such a settlement are by no means satisfactory. In
many places, on these extensive openings, there are naked and barren
layers of calcareous rock, whose surface exhibits appearances
analogous to those in Ontario. The limestone is, however, of a
darker color, and contains numerous imbedded nodules of hornstone,
and it emits a fetid odor on breaking.</p>

<p>In crossing the elevated calcareous highlands, between Danville
and Arkport, in Steuben County, we perceive in the bluff rocks
which bound the valley of the Conestoga River, at an elevation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
perhaps two hundred feet above its bed, horizontal water-marks,
deeply impressed upon the face of the rocks, as if the waters had
formerly stood at that level; and it is impossible to resist the conviction,
in travelling over this rugged district of country, that
it has not been totally submerged by waters, which have been
suddenly drawn off, but by gradual or periodical exhaustions,
standing for many ages at different levels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Slate Rocks.</span>&mdash;These were, not inaptly, denominated "brittle
slate," by Dr. Mitchell, in 1809. Brittleness is their pervading
character; and it is owing to this quality, in a formation of great
thickness, that the action of the water at Niagara Falls is of so
very striking a character. There is no portion of the Niagara
slate solid enough to be used for building stone. It is uniformly
shelly, and exhibits, even in hand specimens, its reproduced character.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[243]</a>
Those portions of the general formation which are solid
constitute silicious slate. A locality of this variety may be seen
at the Halfway House, eight miles east of Canandaigua.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seneca Lake.</span>&mdash;This clear and picturesque lake has its bed in
the secondary formations, and may be referred to as exhibiting
localities of them. Its upper parts afford the compact limestone
in quadrangular blocks. Large portions of its margin consist
of the brittle carbonaceous slate. The shores, from the vicinity
of Rose's Farm to Appletown, are little else but a continuous bank
of the slate. On the opposite coast, it is also visible at various
localities below the Crooked Lake inlet. Cashong Creek may be
particularly referred to. A short ascent of its valley brings the
spectator into a scene where the walled masses of slaty rock assume
a character of grandeur. Among the recent portions which
have been thrown into the valley, may be seen masses having
large species of the stem-like organic remains, which indicate its
newness as a formation. Here are also disclosed orbicular masses,
and pebbles of other rocks, imbedded in the slate. These prove
it to be&mdash;what its texture would, in other places, indicate&mdash;a secondary
slate.</p>

<p>The order of position on the banks of this lake is the same as
at Niagara; but the sandstone is not apparent above the water
line. Its existence, in the bed of the lake, may be satisfactorily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
inferred, from the masses of yellow coarse sand which are driven
up at the foot of the lake, and particularly around its outlet.
When the winds prevail, the water is driven violently against
this part of the shore. As it is an alluvial flat, they soon surmount
the stated margin, and produce a partial inundation. On
their recession, wreathes of sand remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diluvial Elevations.</span>&mdash;Bounding the alluvial plain of the
Seneca outlet westward, there is a series of remarkable wave-like
ridges, whose direction is parallel to that of the lake. On the
declivity-stop of the first of these ridges, stands the village of
Geneva, the buildings of which are thus displayed in an amphitheatric
manner above the clear expanse of the lake. The substratum
of these ridges is an argillaceous, compact soil of the
eldest formation. Some parts of it are a stiff clay, and yield septaria;
but there is no considerable portion of it, which has been
examined, wholly destitute of primitive boulders and pebbles.
Little doubt can remain but that it is the result of the broken-down
slaty rock mixed with the extraneous and far-fetched primitive
masses. They are conclusive of its diluvial character. I
have attentively examined this formation, in the section of it exposed
on the shores of the lake between the village of Geneva and
Two-mile Point. All its solid, stony contents are piled along
the margin of the lake, the soil being completely washed away.
Granite, quartz, and trap pebble-stones and boulders, are here
promiscuously strewn with recent debris. Over the argillaceous
deposit is spread a mantle of newer soil, of unequal depth and
character, which forms, exclusively, the theatre of farming and
horticultural labors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Springs.</span>&mdash;On the declivity of one of these parallel
ridges, at the distance of two miles from the lake, is found an extensive
bed of white marl. This deposit, which is on the estate of
the late Judge Nicholas, covers many acres, and yields so copious
a spring of pure water that it is sufficient, at the distance of about
three hundred yards from its issue, to turn a gristmill. There
are to be found in this bed of marl several species of helix and
voluta. The marl is generally covered with an alluvial deposit
of two feet in depth. The depth of the marl itself is unexplored.
Is not this marl the result of decomposed sea shells?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beds of Quartzose Sand.</span>&mdash;In certain parts of the Seneca
Valley are found limited deposits of a white quartzose sand, in a
state of comparative purity. This substance is capable of being
readily vitrified by the addition of alkaline fluxes, and is thus
converted into glass. Its existence, as a local deposit, beneath
separate strata of alluvial soil, supporting a growth of trees and
shrubs, is such as to render it probable that the present stream,
in its exhausted state, could have had no agency in producing
these deposits. If we are compelled to look to a former condition
of the waters passing off through this valley, as affording the requisite
power of deposit, we are then carried back to an era in
the geology of the country which we must refer to, to account
for by far the greater number of changes in all its recent soils.
Indeed, wherever we examine these soils, out of the range comprehended
between high- and low-water mark, on any existing
lake or stream, there will be found occasion to resort to the agency
of more general and anterior submersions. A few localities may
be appealed to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Wood.</span>&mdash;In digging a well in the Genesee Valley, one
mile east of the river (at Hosmer's), part of the trunk of a tree, of
mature growth, was found at the depth of forty-one feet below
the surface. The soil was a loose sand mixed with gravel. The
position is more elevated than the flats, so called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antlers.</span>&mdash;A large pair of elk's horns were discovered in an
excavation made for the foundation of a mill at Clyde, in Seneca
County. They were imbedded in alluvial soil, ten feet below the
surface. This surface had been cleared of elm and other forest
trees of mature growth. Near the same place, logs of wood were
found at the depth of fourteen feet. These discoveries were made
in the valley of Clyde River, which is formed by the junction of
the Canandaigua Outlet with Mud Creek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frogs Enclosed in the Geological Column.</span>&mdash;At Carthage,
on the Genesee, twelve or fifteen frogs were found in excavating
a layer of compact clay marl, about nine feet below the surface.
The position is several hundred feet above the bed of the Genesee
River, to which elevation no one, after viewing the spot, will
deem it probable its waters could have reached, this side of the
diluvian era.</p>

<p>A frog was dug out of the solid rock, at Lockport, Niagara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
County, by the workmen engaged in excavating the canal. It
was enveloped by the limestone which abounds in cavities filled
with crystals of strontian and dog-tooth spar. It came to life for
a few moments, and then expired. There was no aperture by
which it could possibly communicate with the atmospheric air.
The cavity was only large enough to retain it, without allowing
room for motion.</p>

<p>The inclosure of animals of the inferior classes in the sedimentary
strata, and even in the most solid substance of rock, is a fact
which has been frequently noticed, without, however, any very
satisfactory theory having been given of the process, at least to
common apprehension. <i>Vide</i> <a href="#ADDENDA">Addenda</a>, for some further notices
of this kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Vegetation.</span>&mdash;A well was dug in the lower part of the
village of Geneva, in 1820, which disclosed, at the depth of thirteen
feet, the branches and buds of a cedar-tree. They were found
lying across the excavation, and in the sides of it; and were in
excellent preservation. No one could conjecture in what age
they had been buried. But this discovery would seem to establish
the position that the catastrophe occurred <i>in the spring</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madrepore.</span>&mdash;A madrepore, measuring eight inches in diameter,
was found in the upland soil of Caledonia, Genesee County.
Smaller specimens of the same species occur in that township.
Madrepores of a large size have also been found imbedded in the
soil, or lying on the surface, in various places in Cattaraugus and
Alleghany counties. They are locally denominated petrified
wasps' nests. The lands containing these loose fossil remains are
contiguous to, or based on, secondary rocks at considerable elevations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boulders and Primitive Gravel.</span>&mdash;But the most abundant
evidences of diluvial action are furnished by the masses of foreign
crystalline rocks which are scattered, in blocks of various sizes,
on the surface of the soil, or imbedded at all depths within it.
Primitive rocks are foreign to the district, and these masses could
not, therefore, have resulted from local disintegration. They
must have been transported from a distance. They required not
only an adequate cause for their removal, but one commensurate
with the effects. Such a cause Cuvier supposes, in discussing
the general question, may have existed in eruptions, or in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
action of oceanic masses of water, operating at an ancient
period.</p>

<p>The latter opinion appears to be generally adopted. Dr.
Mitchell, in reference to northwestern boulders, attributes their
distribution over secondary regions to the draining of interior seas
or lakes. Mr. Hayden, in his <i>Geological Essays</i>, refers them to
the action of oceanic currents setting "from north and east to
south and west."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subordinate and Equivalent Strata.</span>&mdash;These constitute
the most intricate subjects of reference. They are either adjuncts
or residuary deposits of leading formations. But their order, as
accompanying series, must sometimes be sought for by a previous
determination of the formations themselves. Could we certainly
know, for instance, that the sandstone of Western New York is
or is not the true coal-sandstone, or the limestone is or is not the
carboniferous limestone, it would at once direct to positive eras,
and serve to impart confidence in the prediction of unknown
deposits of an important character. But, in order to fix the
formations, it is often the safest mode of procedure to employ the
subordinate and local deposits as evidences of the character of the
formations embracing them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gypsum.</span>&mdash;A stratum of gypsum of the plaster of Paris kind&mdash;that
is, consisting of an admixture of the carbonate with the sulphate
of lime&mdash;occurs on the banks of the Canandaigua outlet.
It has been chiefly explored in the township of Phelps, Ontario.
In visiting the principal bed (1820), I found the following order
of deposits composing the banks of the outlet:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Alluvial soil of a dark, arenaceous, and mellow character,
having small stones of the primitive kind sparingly interspersed,
two and a half to three feet. Cultivated in improved farms.</p>

<p>2. Shelly limestone, of an earthy, dull-gray color and loose texture,
in layers, three feet.</p>

<p>3. Limestone of a more firm character, but still shelly, or rather
slaty, fissile, and easily quarried, six feet. This stratum contains
iron pyrites in a decomposed state. Also, nodular or kidney-shaped
masses of what the quarrymen call <i>plaster-eggs</i>&mdash;apparently
snowy gypsum.</p>

<p>4. Plaster of Paris, ten feet. This stratum yields granular,
earthy, fibrous, and foliated gypsum. It is the first two varieties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
which are quarried. In some places, the mass is firm enough to
admit of blasting. In others, it is loose and veiny, and is readily
broken up with iron bars and sledges. Portions of it appear to
consist of a shelly limestone identical with No. 2. They are rejected
in quarrying.</p>

<p>5. Limestone similar to No. 3, four feet.</p>

<p>At this depth it is covered by the waters of the outlet. How
deep it extends is uncertain. The rapids at the village of Vienna
are caused by shelving strata of this limestone.</p>

<p>There is a suite character in these strata which appears to constitute
them a single deposit. The plaster-bed at Canasaraga
exists in a ledge more elevated in reference to the local stream,
and presents a broader section of the limestone. The shades of
difference which are observable in its color and texture, do not
appear to indicate a difference of geological era. Nor do appearances
denote, for the calcareous formation which embraces these
beds, much antiquity in the scale of secondary rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saliferous Red Clay-marl.</span>&mdash;Examinations, at various points,
render it a probable supposition that the red clay-marl of western
New York is the equivalent for the new red sandstone, in positions
where the latter is&mdash;as it often is&mdash;wanting. It is extensively
deposited in the upland soils, in the range of the salt rock
and gypsum counties, from the summit grounds of Oneida County
west. It may be seen in various stages of the decomposition. I
have more attentively examined it on the upper parts of the
Scanado<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[244]</a> and Oneida creeks. Large areas of it exist in Westmoreland,
Verona, and Vernon townships, and bordering the
valley grounds of the Oneida reservation, and the northerly portions
of Sullivan County. The existence of salt water might,
apparently, be searched for with as much probability of success,
in the district thus indicated, as at more westerly points.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coal-Formation.</span>&mdash;With a strong predisposition to regard our
leading sandstone and limestone surface-formations as members
of the "independent" or true coal-formation, inquiry has led me
to relinquish the impression that they will, to any great degree,
be found to yield this mineral. If the sandstone is&mdash;as facts indicate
it to be&mdash;the new red or saliferous sandstone, it may be expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
to yield thin seams of coal, in distant places, but no deposit
of this mineral which will reward exploration in this or its super-incumbent
series of rocks, the slates, limestones, &amp;c. It will result,
that the coal-measures, properly so denominated, are a prior
deposit in the order of series; and, should they hereafter be found,
such a discovery must take place above the range of the sandstone,
which is the basis rock at Niagara and Genesee Falls.</p>

<p>Having premised the character of the sandstone, all the series
occupying a position above it must derive their character, as
secondary deposits, from this. The limestone cannot, therefore,
be a part of the carboniferous or "medial." The slates, as shown
at Cashong, are fragmentary, and rather nearer slaty grauwacks.
The arenaceous and calcareous upper deposits assume
nearly the position of the oolitic series, and, in fact, ought, in
some localities, to be regarded as equivalents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Western Coal-Mines.</span>&mdash;Much of the data employed in these
inquiries is the result of previous examinations of the great coal
deposits in the Ohio Valley, and other parts of the western country.
Here we have the coal-sandstone and the slate clay, with slate,
&amp;c., alternating with the coal-measures. Such is the order of
deposits at the junction of the Alleghany and Monongahela, where
the formation is well developed, and where there exists, too, in
the elevated valley hills, several repetitions of the series. The
zechstone, or compact limestone, which is a pervading rock in
the Mississippi Valley, occupies a position next above the great
Mississippi sandstone.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[245]</a> It may always be distinguished from the
shelly, entrochal limestone of the Genesee,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[246]</a> by the absence of
gypsum and of the fetid odor emitted on fracture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alleghany Valley.</span>&mdash;A question of interest, in connection
with the extent of the Ohio Valley coal-formation, arises from
the attempt to fix the point to which this formation ascends the
Alleghany Valley&mdash;being the direct avenue into Western New
York. I have examined this valley in its entire length between
Pittsburg and Olean, in Cattaraugus County, and have not been
able to observe that there are any evidences of its termination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
below the latter point. The general order and parallelism of
strata remain the same. The coal stratum is apparently present.
The qualities of the coal at Armstrong, and at various points
below French Creek&mdash;the first primary fork of the river&mdash;are
not distinguishable from the products of the Pittsburg galleries.
Less search has been made above that point, but wherever the
hills have been penetrated, they have&mdash;as at Brokenstraw&mdash;produced
the bituminous coal. Above the Conawango Valley, which
brings in the redundant waters of Chatauque Lake, the Alleghany
discloses frequent rapids. The effect of parallelism upon the
strata is to sink the coal-measures deeper as they ascend the
Alleghany; and this cause may, in connection with the unexplored
character of the country, be referred to in accounting for the
absence of coal along this part of the line. The reappearance of
traces of this mineral at Potato Creek, forty miles above Olean, is
a proof, however, that the coal-formation extends to that point.
This locality is a few miles within the limits of Pennsylvania. It
occurs in a valley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coal in Western New York.</span>&mdash;The coal-bed above Olean is
south of the summit of the Genesee, and not remote from its primary
source. The expectation may be indulged that the western
coal-formation embraces portions of Cattaraugus and Alleghany
or Steuben counties. The noted spring of naphtha, called Seneca
Oil, is on Oil Creek in this county. As this substance, in the class
of bitumens, is nearly allied to the coal series, it may be deemed
favorable to the existence of the formation in the substrata.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[247]</a>
Fragments of carbonized wood are frequently found in the large
tracts of marine sand,<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[248]</a> as well as in some of the mixed alluvions
of these counties; and it needs but an examination, as cursory as
it has fallen to my lot to make, of this portion of the country, to
render it one of high geological interest, and to denote that the
coal-measures probably extend into some portions of Western
New York.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[249]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p class="subsection"><a name="ADDENDA" id="ADDENDA"></a>ADDENDA.<br />
<i>Animals inclosed in Rock, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toads.</span>&mdash;In 1770, a toad was brought to Mr. Grignon inclosed
in two hollow shells of stone; but, on examining it nicely, Mr. G.
discovered that the cavity bore the impression of a shell-fish,
and, of consequence, he concluded it to be apocryphal.</p>

<p>In 1771, another instance occurred, and was the subject of a
curious memoir read by Mr. Guettard to the Royal Academy of
Sciences at Paris. It was thus related by that famous naturalist:&mdash;</p>

<p>In pulling down a wall, which was known to have existed upwards
of a hundred years, a toad was found without the smallest
aperture being discoverable by which it could have entered.
Upon inspecting the animal, it was apparent that it had been
dead but a very little time; and in this state it was presented to
the Academy, which induced Mr. Guettard to make repeated inquiries
into the subject, the particulars of which will be read with
pleasure in the excellent memoir we have just cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worms.</span>&mdash;Two living worms were found, in Spain, in the middle
of a block of marble which a sculptor was carving into a lion,
of the natural color, for the royal family. These worms occupied
two small cavities to which there was no inlet that could possibly
admit the air. They subsisted, probably, on the substance of the
marble, as they were the same color. This fact is verified by
Captain Ulloa, a famous Spaniard, who accompanied the French
academicians in their voyage to Peru to ascertain the figure of
the earth. He asserts that he saw these two worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adder.</span>&mdash;We read in the <i>Affiches de Provence</i>, 17 June, 1772,
that an adder was found alive in the centre of a block of marble
thirty feet in diameter. It was folded nine times round, in a
spiral line. It was incapable of supporting the air, and died a
few minutes after. Upon examining the stone, not the smallest
trace was to be found by which it could have glided in or received
air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crawfish.</span>&mdash;Misson, in his <i>Travels through Italy</i>, mentions a
crawfish that was found alive in the middle of a marble in the
environs of Tivoli.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frogs.</span>&mdash;M. Peyssonel, king's physician at Guadaloupe, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
ordered a pit to be dug in the back part of his house, live frogs
were found by the workmen in beds of petrifaction. M. P., suspecting
some deceit, descended into the pit, dug the bed of the
rock and petrifactions, and drew out himself green frogs, which
were alive, and perfectly similar to what we see every day.</p>

<p>We are informed by the <i>European Magazine</i>, February 21, 1771,
that M. Herissan inclosed three live toads in so many cases of
plaster, and shut them up in a deal box, which he also covered
with thick plaster. On the 6th of April, 1774, having taken
away the plaster, he opened the box, and found the cases whole
and two of the toads alive. The one that died was larger than
the others, and had been more compressed in its case. A careful
examination of this experiment convinced those who had witnessed
it, that the animals were so inclosed that they could have
no possible communication with the external air, and that they
must have existed during this lapse of time without the smallest
nourishment.</p>

<p>The Academy prevailed upon M. Herissan to repeat the experiment.
He inclosed again the two surviving toads, and placed
the box in the hands of the Secretary, that the Society might
open it whenever they should think proper. But this celebrated
naturalist was too strongly interested in the subject to rest satisfied
with a single experiment; he made, therefore, the two following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. He placed, 15 April, 1771, two live toads in a basin of plaster,
which he covered with a glass case that he might observe them
frequently. On the 9th of the following month, he presented the
apparatus to the Academy. One of the toads was still living;
the other had died the preceding night.</p>

<p>2. The same day, April 15, he inclosed another toad in a glass
bottle, which he buried in sand, that it might have no communication
with the external air. This animal, which he presented to
the Academy at the same time, was perfectly well, and even
croaked whenever the bottle was shook in which he was confined.
It is to be lamented that the death of M. Herissan put a stop to
these experiments.</p>

<p>We beg leave to observe upon this subject, that the power
which these animals appear to possess of supporting abstinence
for so long a time, may depend upon a very slow digestion, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
perhaps, from the singular nourishment which they derive from
themselves. M. Grignon observes that this animal sheds its skin
several times in the course of a year, and that it always swallows
it. He has known, he says, a large toad shed its skin six times
in one winter. In short, those which, from the facts we have
related, may be supposed to have existed many centuries without
nourishment, have been in a total inaction, in a suspension of life,
or a temperature that has admitted of no dissolution; so that it
was not necessary to repair any loss, the humidity of the surrounding
matter preserving that of the animal, who wanted only
the component parts not to be dried up, to preserve it from
destruction.</p>

<p>The results of modern chemistry and philosophy have proved
the number of elementary substances to be far greater than was
admitted in the preceding century. And this discovery is progressive,
and will probably go on a long time; after which, it is
not improbable a new race of chemical and philosophical observers
will spring up, who will be able to decompose many substances
we now consider elementary, and thus again reduce the number
of elements of which all external matter is composed. It would
not be wonderful if posterity should reduce the number of elements
even as low as the ancients had them. Such a result would
throw new light on the mysterious and intricate connection which
seems to exist between animal, vegetable, and mineral matter.
We should then, perhaps, have less cause to wonder that toads,
&amp;c., are capable of supporting life in stone, that birds should exist
in solid blocks of wood, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But toads are not the only animals which are capable of living
for a considerable length of time without nourishment and communication
with the external air. The instances of the oysters
and dactyles, mentioned at the beginning of this article, may be
advanced as a proof of it. But there are other examples.&mdash;<i>European
Magazine</i>, March, 1791.</p>

<p>A beetle, of the species called capricorn, was found in a piece
of wood in the hold of a ship at Plymouth. The wood had no
external mark of any aperture.&mdash;<i>European Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>A bug eat itself out of a cherry table at Williamstown, Mass.
See an account of this phenomenon, by Professor Dewey, in the
<i>Lit. and Philos. Repertory</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>These phenomena remind us of others of a similar nature and
equally certain.</p>

<p>In a trunk of an elm, about the size of a man's body, three or
four feet above the root, and precisely in the centre, was found,
in 1719, a live toad, of a moderate size, thin, and which occupied
but a very small space. As soon as the wood was cut, it came
out and slipped away very alertly. No tree could be more sound.
No place could be discovered through which it was possible for
the animal to have penetrated, which led the recorder of the fact
to suppose that the spawn from which it originated must, from
some unaccountable accident, have been in the tree from the very
moment of its first vegetation. The toad had lived in the tree
without air, and, what is still more surprising, had subsisted on
the substance of the wood, and had grown in proportion as the
tree had grown. This fact was attested by M. Hebert, Ancient
Professor of Philosophy at Caen.</p>

<p>In 1731, M. Leigne wrote to the Academy of Sciences at Paris
an account of a phenomenon exactly similar to the preceding one,
except that the tree was larger, and was an oak instead of an
elm, which makes the instance the more surprising. From the
size of the oak, M. Leigne judged that the toad must have existed
in it without air or any external nourishment, for the space
of eighty or a hundred years.</p>

<p>We shall cite a third instance, related in a letter the 5th Feb.
1780, written from the neighborhood of Saint Mexent, of which
the following is a copy.</p>

<p>"A few days ago, I ordered an oak tree of a tolerable size to
be cut down, and converted into a beam that was wanting for a
building I was then constructing. Having separated the head
from the trunk, three men were employed in squaring it to the
proper size. About four inches were to be cut away on each
side. I was present during the transaction. Conceive what was
their astonishment when I saw them throw aside their tools, start
back from the tree, and fix their eyes on the same point with a
kind of amazement and terror. I instantly approached, and
looked at that part of the tree which had fixed their attention.
My surprise equalled theirs, on seeing a toad, about the size of a
large pullet's egg, incrusted, in a manner, in the tree, at the distance
of four inches from the diameter and fifteen from the root.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
It was cut and mangled by the axe, but still moved. I drew it
with difficulty from its abode, or rather prison, which it filled so
completely that it seemed to have been compressed. I placed it
on the grass; it appeared old, thin, languishing, decrepit. We
afterwards examined the tree with the nicest care, to discover
how it had glided in; but the tree was perfectly whole and sound."&mdash;<i>European

<i>A Memoir on the Geological Position of a Fossil-Tree in the Series of
the Secondary Rocks of the Illinois.</i></h4>

<p>The spirit of inquiry which has been excited in this country
in regard to objects of natural history, while it has enlarged the
boundaries of our knowledge of existing species, has directed
some of its more valuable researches to those organized forms
which have perished and become embalmed in the shape of
petrifactions, in the body of solid rocks. A petrified tree of
this kind has recently been discovered in the secondary<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[250]</a> rocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
at the source of the Illinois River. Having recently visited this
evidence of former changes in the flora of the West, I embrace
the occasion, while my recollections are fresh, to give an account
of it.</p>

<p>The tract of country separating the southern shores of Lake
Michigan from the Illinois River, is a plat of table-land composed
of compact limestone, based on floetz or horizontal sandstone.
This formation embraces the contiguous parts of Illinois, and
spreads through Indiana, Ohio, and the Peninsula of Michigan.
It is overspread with a deposit of the drift era, covered with a
stratum of alluvial soil, presenting a pleasing surface of prairies,
forests, and streams. These features may be considered as peculiarly
characteristic of the junction of the Rivers Kankakee and
Des Plaines, which constitute the Illinois River. This junction
is effected about forty miles south of Chicago.</p>

<p>The fossil in question occurs about forty rods above the junction
of the Kankakee. The sandstone embracing it is deposited
in perfectly horizontal layers, of a gray color and close grain. It
lies in the bed of the Des Plaines. The action of this stream has
laid bare the trunk of the tree to the extent of fifty-one feet six
inches. The part at the point where it is overlaid in the western
bank is two feet six inches in diameter. Its mineralization is
complete. The trunk is simple, straight, scabrous, without
branches, and has the usual taper observed in the living specimen.
It lies nearly at right angles to the course of the river,
pointing towards the southeast, and extends about half the width
of the stream. Notwithstanding the continual abrasion to which
it is exposed by the volume of passing water, it has suffered little
apparent diminution, and is still firmly imbedded in the rock,
with the exception of two or three places where portions of it
have been disengaged and carried away; but no portion of what
remains is elevated more than a few inches above the surface of
the rock. It is owing, however, to those partial disturbances
that we are enabled to perceive the columnar form of the trunk,
its cortical layers, the bark by which it is enveloped, and the
peculiar cross fracture, which unite to render the evidence of its
ligneous origin so striking and complete. From these characters
and appearances, little doubt can remain that it is referable to the
species juglans nigra, a tree very common to the forest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Illinois, as well as to most other parts of the immense region
drained by the waters of the Mississippi. The woody structure
is most obvious in the outer rind of the trunk, extending to a
depth of two or three inches, and these appearances become less
evident as we approximate the heart. Indeed, the traces of organic
structure in its interior, particularly when viewed in the
hand specimen, are almost totally obliterated and exchanged, the
vegetable matter being replaced by a mixed substance, analogous,
in its external character, to some of the silicated and impure calcareous
carbonates of the region. Like those carbonates, it is of
a brownish-gray color and compact texture, effervesces slightly
in the nitric and muriatic acids, yields a white streak under the
knife, and presents solitary points, or facets, of crystals resembling
calc spar. All parts of the tree are penetrated by pyrites of iron
of a brass yellow color, disseminated through the most solid and
stony parts of the interior, filling interstices in the outer rind, or
investing its capillary pores. There are also the appearances of
rents or seams between the fibres of the wood, caused by its own
shrinkage, which are now filled with a carbonate of lime, of a
white color and crystallized.</p>

<p>From an effect analogous to carbonization, the exterior rind
and bark of the tree have acquired a blackish-hue, while the inclosing
rock is of a light-gray color, characters which are calculated
to arrest attention.</p>

<p>There is reason to conclude that the subject under consideration
is the joint result, partly of the infiltration of mineral matter
into its pores and crevices, prior to inclosure in the rock, and
partly to the chemical action educed by the great catastrophe by
which it was translated from its parent forest, and suddenly enveloped
in a bed of solidifying sand.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit (August 13, 1821), the depth of water
upon the floetz rocks forming the bed of the River Des Plaines,
would vary from one to two feet; but it was at a season when
these higher tributaries, and the Illinois itself, are generally at
their lowest stage. Like most of the confluent rivers of the Mississippi
and their tributaries, the Des Plaines is subject to great
fluctuations, and during its periodical floods may be estimated to
carry a depth of eight or ten feet of water to the junction of the
Kankakee. At those periods, the water is also rendered turbid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
by the quantity of alluvial matter it carries down, and a search
for this organic fossil must prove unsuccessful. But during the
prevalence of the summer droughts, in an atmosphere of little
humidity, when the waters are drained to the lowest point of depression,
and acquire the greatest degree of transparency, it forms
a very conspicuous trait in the geology of the stream, and no person,
seeking the spot, can fail to be directed to it.</p>

<p>The sand-rock containing this petrifaction is found in a horizontal
position, differing only with respect to hardness and color.
The remains of fossil organized bodies in this stratum are not
abundant, or have not been successfully sought. It is probable
that future observations will prove that its organic conservata
are chiefly referable to the vegetable kingdom. It is certain, that
this inference is justified by the facts which are before me, and
particularly by the characteristic appearances of the strata in the
bed of the River Des Plaines, where the imbedded walnut is the
representative of the ancient flora. At a short distance above,
where the bed of the Des Plaines approaches nearer the summit
level, limestone ensues, and continues from that point northward
to the shores of Lake Michigan. In the vicinity of Chicago,
where this limestone is quarried for economical purposes, it is
characterized by the fossil remains of molluscous species.</p>

<p>Lake Erie lies at an elevation of five hundred and sixty-five
feet above the Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[251]</a></p>

<p>There exists a water communication between the head of Lake
Michigan, at Chicago, and the River Des Plaines, during the
periodical rises of the latter, but its summer level is about seven
feet lower, at the termination of the Chicago portage, than the
surface of the lake. From this point to its junction with the
Kankakee, a computed distance of fifty miles, the bed of the Des
Plaines may be considered as having a mean southern depression
of ten inches per mile, so that the floetz rocks at its mouth, lying
on a level of forty-eight feet eight inches below the surface of
Lake Michigan, have an altitude which cannot vary far from five
hundred and fifty feet above the Atlantic. There are no mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
for a vast distance either east or west of this stream. It is a
country of plains, in which are occasionally to be seen alluvial
hills of moderate elevation; but the most striking inequalities of
surface proceed from the streams which have worn their deep-seated
channels through it; and an oceanic overflow capable of
covering the country, and producing these strata by deposition,
would also submerge all the immense tracts of secondary and
alluvial country between the Alleghany and the Rocky Mountains,
converting into an arm of the sea the great valley of the Mississippi,
from the Gulf of Mexico north to the Canadian Lakes. We
find in the alluvial soil along the Illinois and Des Plaines blocks
of granite, hornblende, and gneiss, of the drift stratum, exhibiting
the same appearances of attrition, and of having been transported
from their parent beds, which characterize the secondary tablelands
along the margin of the great American lakes, the prairies
of Illinois, and the western parts of New York.</p>

<p>There is nothing, perhaps, in the progress of modern science,
which has tended to facilitate geological research so much as the
study and investigation of fossil organic remains. They teach,
with unerring lights, how extensively the ancient flora and fauna
of this continent have been prostrated, leaving their exact impressions,
in all their minuteness, in the newly-formed stratifications.
That these impressions, fresh and vivid as we find them, should
mark the eras of depositions and crystallization of rocks from
the suspension of their elements in water, is the observation of
Werner, and it is to him we owe the elements of the Neptunian
hypothesis. His general recognition of the epochs of the primitive,
transition, and secondary rocks, appears too probable not to
commend itself to adoption with regard to all strata which can be
conceived to be the products of watery menstrua.</p>

<p>But it remained for Werner, who was the first to perceive an
order in strata, also to point out the important application of fossil
organic bodies in elucidating their eras, and the natural order of
their superposition.</p>

<p>To adopt the words of Dr. Thomas Cooper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There appears to be a series of strata, or, as Werner calls
them, formations, that may be considered as surrounding the
nucleus of the earth. The first formed, or lowest series, always
preserve the same situation to each other, except where occasional
eruptions, or circumstances not of a general nature, make a variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
in their situations. These strata are not only the deepest, but
they are also the highest that are observable in the crust of the
earth; forming the tops of the highest mountains. They are characterized
by an appearance of crystallization, and by containing
no remains of organic matter, animal or vegetable. The strata or
formations that in general constitute this first, deepest, highest,
and crystallized series, are granite, gneiss, mica-slate, clay-slate,
primitive greenstone, granular limestone, serpentine, porphyry,
and sienite. These formations are so generally found, and in the
same situations as incumbent upon or subtending each other relatively,
that they may be considered as universal. Their crystallized
appearance shows that their particles have either been
dissolved or very finely suspended in water, so that the attraction
of crystallization has been free to operate; that this water has
been deep, so that the lowermost parts of it have not been much
agitated during the crystallization, which would otherwise have
been more confused than it is; and, indeed, the oldest formations
are the best crystallized. A part of the water covering the
nucleus must have been taken up, as water of crystallization, in
the primitive formations. When these were deposited, there were
no vegetables formed; of course, no animals; nay, even the sea
was unpeopled, for there is no trace of any organic remains in
these strata. Even the belemnites, the asteriæ, the echini, the
entrochi, the most simple forms of oceanic animal life, do not
occur until the transition strata appear. Hence the propriety of
denominating these formations <i>primitive</i>.</p>

<p>"By processes of nature, besides the consumption of water by
the new crystallized masses, to us unknown, the waters appear to
have diminished. The highest parts of the primitive formations
became the shores to the water superincumbent on their bases
and middle regions; the simplest forms of oceanic animals came
into existence; the mosses and lichens of high latitude would
generally occupy the surface of the primitive strata, gradually
decomposed by the alternate action of air and water after many
ages. During this period, while the strata were in a state of
<i>transition</i> from the chaotic to the habitable state, other deposits
would gradually be made from the waters, now decreased in quantity,
and take their place below the summits of the primitive
range. Those summits being exposed to the action of the atmosphere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of rains, of frost probably, and to the action also of the
waters with their contents still incumbent on the earliest strata,
would furnish masses and particles washed away, which would
mingle with the deposits of the transition series. This series,
therefore, will exhibit appearances of mechanical and chemical
intermixture of earths and stones, such as are found in the silicious
porphyries, the graywackes, the silicious and argillaceous hornblende
rocks, the elder red sandstone, &amp;c. During the period
when these transition formations were deposited, there would be
no land animals, for there would be no vegetables for them to
feed upon. There would be no vegetables unless some few lichens,
mosses, or ericas, that would find foothold upon the slight decomposition
that, after the lapse of some ages, would take place on
the surface of the primitive rocks. The sea only would be peopled,
and that but sparingly; for, in that mass of muddy water,
none but the lowest and most inferior grades of animal life, and
such as do not inhabit deep water, could exist. Hence, we find
the transition formations contain in their substances some belemnites,
asteriæ, entrochi, echini, &amp;c., but no organized vegetable
substance except, very rarely, in the latest rocks of this series,
and no remains whatever of terrestrial animals. Indeed, in the
high latitudes of the outgoings or summits of the primitive strata,
very few vegetables, even at the present day, can live. No vegetation
fit for animal life could take place until the transition, and
most of the next series of <i>secondary</i> or <i>floetz</i> formations had subsided.
These would occupy lower and lower situations, till a rich
soil, from every kind of intermixture of earth mechanically deposited,
would afford a proper temperature of region, and an easily
decomposed soil, wherein vegetables could grow.</p>

<p>"Next to the transition series, come the <i>secondary</i>, or, as the
German mineralogists call them, the <i>floetz</i> rocks; so called, because
they appear to be more floated or horizontal, though I confess
the appellation does not appear to me peculiarly appropriate.
These strata consist principally of sandstone, limestone&mdash;sometimes
fetid from bituminous impregnations, sometimes shelly&mdash;secondary
greenstone, graphite, coal, gypsum, rock salt. I have
observed that the Alpine heights of the primitive mountains
could at no time furnish much food. The same remark, but in
a less degree, will apply to the transition range; the low and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
kindly climates occupied by the secondary series. The soft and
decomposable nature of these depositions would furnish the true
theatre of vegetable life, and, until these regions were filled with
vegetables, the race of animals could not have been produced; for
on what could they subsist? Graminivorous animals, therefore,
must have succeeded the various forms of vegetable existence;
and carnivorous, the graminivorous. The vegetable matter imbedded
in the substance of the secondary strata will consist of
the remains of vegetables that grow in the transition strata; and
the animal remains will consist chiefly of such animals as were
produced in the early stages of animal existence, particularly the
smaller aquatic animals; and, of these, chiefly shell-fish, as shells
are not so soon decomposed as mere animal substance."</p>

<p>It is to the latter class of depositions&mdash;to the secondary series&mdash;that
we must refer the sandstone of the River Des Plaines, in
which we find a walnut, of mature growth, enveloped by, and
imbedded in the rock, in the most complete state of mineralization;
and, since all geological writers who subscribe to the Neptunian
theory are constrained to employ the agency of oceanic
depositions of different eras, in explaining the structure of the
earth's surface, it is one of the most obvious and important conclusions,
to be drawn from the fact that such submersions and
depositions of rock matter have taken place subsequent to the
existence of forests of mature growth, and that the rock strata
and beds composing the exterior of the earth are the result of
different geological epochs, and of successive subsidences of chaotic
matter&mdash;positions which have been so severely attacked and so
often denied, particularly by the disciples of the Huttonian
school, that it is not without a feeling of lively interest, I communicate
a discovery which appears so conclusive on the subject.</p>

<p>Considerations arising from the frontier position of the country,
and the infrequency of the communication, have also induced me
to draw from incidental sources, a corroboration of the facts
advanced.</p>

<p>In a letter to Governor Cass, of Michigan, dated September 17,
1821, I made the following observations on the subject under
review:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I consider the petrified tree discovered during our recent
journey up the Illinois, so extraordinary an object in the natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
history of the country, and calculated to lead to conclusions so
important to the science of geology, that I am anxious to avail
myself of your concurrent testimony as to the fact of the existence
of the tree in a mineralized state, and the natural appearances
of the spot where it lies imbedded. I feel the more solicitude on
this subject, as I am aware that any description of this phenomenon
which I may be induced to communicate to the public,
will be received with a degree of caution and scrutiny which it is
the province of the naturalist to exercise whenever any discovery
is announced affecting the existing theories of the natural sciences,
or tending to increase the volume of facts upon which their advancement
and perfection depend. I am aware, also, that whatever
degree of caution and vigilance it may be proper to exercise
to prevent errors from mingling with the sound doctrines of the
physical and other sciences, still more care and circumspection is
requisite in examining facts which affect the progress of geology."</p>

<p>I quote an extract from Governor Cass's reply on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The appearance of the wood and bark indicates that it was a
black walnut, the juglans nigra of our forests. We computed its
original diameter, at the place where it is concealed in the earth,
to have been three feet, and at the other end eighteen inches.
The texture of the wood, and the bark and knots, are nearly as
distinct as in the living subject, and the process of decay had not
commenced previous to the commencement of this wonderful conversion.
Every part of the mass which we could examine is
solid stone, and readily yields fire by the collision with steel.</p>

<p>"When we visited the spot, the water of the river was at the
lowest stage; but there was no part of the tree within some
inches of the surface. The rocky bed of the stream was formed
round and upon it. We raised from it pieces of the rock, which
were evidently <i>in situ</i>, and which had been formed upon the tree
posterior to the period of its deposit in its present situation. This
rock is a species of sandstone, whose characteristic features must
be well known to you.</p>

<p>"There are no mineralized substances of vegetable origin in the
vicinity of this specimen, nor are there any appearances which
indicate that its present condition has been caused by any peculiar
property in the waters of the Des Plaines."</p>

<p class="subsection">ADDENDA.</p>

<p>The publication of the foregoing memoir led to several letters
being addressed to the author on topics connected with it. Some
of these were from gentlemen eminent in science or politics, whose
opinions are entitled to the highest respect. Extracts are given
from such only as introduce new data, either of fact or opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Theories.</span>&mdash;Professor Dewey, of Williams College,
observes: "A friend has just lent me your 'Memoir on a
Fossil-Tree.' Though the account is very interesting, I do not
perceive its exact bearing on the Neptunian and Plutonian hypotheses.
The fault is doubtless in me, and you will excuse my
remarks and set me right. I had supposed the Huttonians and
Wernerians did not dispute about the manner in which the <i>secondary</i>
rocks were formed. Macculloch, and others before him,
led me into this opinion, though it may be erroneous. But
Bakewell, who is referred to as authority in <i>Rees's Cyclopædia</i>,
says, p. 131: 'Geologists are agreed that secondary rocks have
been formed by the agency of water.' If this be so, they would
agree generally with the account of Dr. Cooper respecting the
formation of petrifactions, and especially those of vegetables, and
the fossil-tree would be treated of in a similar manner by both."</p>

<p>Hutton's original hypothesis, and not the modifications of it
introduced by the Neptu-Vulcanists, were adverted to in reply.
Subsequently, Professor Dewey writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was greatly obliged by your letter in various respects, and I
write you now to make my acknowledgments for it, as well as to
maintain the correctness of your notions on the Huttonian hypothesis.
As you had seen a Scotch mineralogist directly from the
mint of Playfair, I had every reason to suppose you had received
correct views of Playfair's notions on the subject. I have been
led, therefore, to examine the matter, and, as I may have set you
on the search, I wish to prevent your continuing it on my account,
or from what I wrote.</p>

<p>"Playfair's Illustrations I have never seen. Occasional extracts,
or allusions to its points, have fallen in my way. But I
have before me a very full abstract of Hutton's paper on the subject,
from the <i>Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</i>. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
is from the very paper in which he announces his hypothesis. In
that paper he mentions that the consolidation of all the hard crust
of the globe has been effected by <i>heat</i> and <i>fusion</i>, extending it to
secondary as well as primitive rocks, and mentioning particularly
Spanish marble, shell limestone, oolite, and chalk.</p>

<p>"This operation of heat, he says, is exemplified by <i>chalk, which
is to be found in all gradations, from marble to loose chalk</i>. This is
his precise notion, but not his words. I had once looked at this
paper before, and thought much of this theory; but this thought
had been obliterated from my mind by thoughts advanced by
others, as I thought in consistency with the sentence I quoted
from Bakewell. At least, one objection to Hutton's views would
be removed by modifying his theory in the manner it seems to
be by Bakewell. Though Hutton does not think this to be necessary;
for he appears to feel no difficulty in accounting for
petrifactions of wood on his hypothesis, for he mentions that <i>we
have many proofs of the penetration of flinty matter, in a state of fusion,
in other bodies, such as insulated pieces of flint in chalk or sand, and
fossil wood penetrated with silicious matter</i>.</p>

<p>"Still, the grand reasons of Hutton for employing heat as the
agent of consolidation are opposed to the above modification of
his theory. These reasons, as you know, are the insolubility of
most mineral substances in water, and the disappearance of the
water from the cavities of minerals which have been consolidated.
The first is, indeed, the great one for Hutton; for the crystallization
of salts in water, and the existence of liquids, in some cases,
in the cavities of the most solid minerals, show well enough that
the water might or might not disappear, as the circumstances
were different.</p>

<p>"If the Huttonians maintain, as he did, the formation of petrifactions
by heat, which consistency requires, I concede, indeed, to
you that that fossil-tree stands as a grand monument of some different
process; and yet, we can hardly suppose that they do not
see great difficulty in the common notion on the subject. The
rapidity with which the petrifactions must have taken place&mdash;a
point well illustrated in Hayden's <i>Geological Essays</i>&mdash;seems to
require some new notions on the subject. What these may be,
I cannot tell; but I believe that neither of these two hypotheses
will be adopted exclusively, half a century hence, on this point,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
or on geology generally. I think, with you, that our countrymen
need illumination on the subject of Hutton's hypothesis, and I
wish some one would attempt it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trap-Rocks of Europe and America.</span>&mdash;"I suspect the greenstone
of our country, when examined as it ought to be, will be
found, in its geological relations, much to resemble the basalt of
Europe; and that the same difficulties will attend it, on Werner's
hypothesis, as now attend the basalt. Indeed, I know not how
we can account for what Bakewell and Macculloch state on this
hypothesis."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandstone of Virginia.</span>&mdash;"I have seen a piece of a petrified
tree, about eight inches through, found in the sandstone of Virginia,
but could get none of it. The petrifaction was far finer
than the stone in which it lay, and was, like it, silex."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandstone of Ohio.</span>&mdash;C. Atwater, Esq., in a letter to the
author, observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I can assure you that the finding of whole trees in sandstone
is nothing strange in this State. Some of these trees are imbedded
in sandstone one hundred feet below the surface. Zanesville
and Gallipolis are the best spots to find these fossils.</p>

<p>"There is no part of the tree but what I have in my cabinet,
not excepting their leaves, fruit, and even fungi attached to them."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mosaical History of the Creation.</span>&mdash;B. Irvine, Esq., in
adverting to remarks on the Illinois fossil, observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They may yet awaken some ideas in the minds of the people
on the wonders of physics&mdash;and I had almost said, the <i>slow miracles
of creation</i>; for, if ever there was a time when matter existed
not, it is pretty evident that <i>millions of years</i>, instead of six days,
were necessary to establish order in chaos, let Cuvier, &amp;c. temporize
as they may. However, it is the humble allotment of the
herd to believe or stare; it is the glory of intelligent men to inquire
and admire."</p>

<p>The doctrine of materialism, adverted to by Mr. Irvine, it is
the province of divines to controvert. One remark may be predicted
on the biblical era of the six days. It is now believed to
be generally conceded by eminent geologists and ecclesiastics,
that the term "day," employed by the translators of the English
version of the Scriptures, is used in Gen. ch. i. in a sense synonymous
with "era" or "time," as it is emphatically used in Gen.

<h3>4. BOTANY.</h3>

<h4>XI.</h4>

<p>A descriptive list of the plants collected on the expedition,
drawn up by Dr. John Torrey, has been published in the fourth
volume of the <i>American Journal of Science</i>. References to this
standard work may be conveniently made by botanists.</p>

<h3>5. ZOOLOGY.</h3>

<p>No professed zoologist was attached to the expedition, the topic
being left to such casual attention as members of it might find it
convenient to bestow. Of the fauna of the region, it was not
believed that there were any of the prominent species which were
improperly classed in the <i>Systema Naturæ</i> of Linnæus. It was
doubtless desirable to know something more particularly of the
character and habitat of the American species of the reindeer (<i>C.
sylvestris</i>) and hyena, or glutton. Perhaps something new was to
be gleaned respecting the extent of the genera arctomys and
sciurus, among the smaller quadrupeds, and in the departments of
birds and reptilia. The mode of travel gave but little opportunity
of meeting the larger species in their native haunts, but it afforded
opportunities of examining the skins of the quadrupeds at the
several trading stations, and of listening to the narrations of persons
who had engaged in their capture.</p>

<p>In effect, the crustacea of the streams furnished the most constant
and affluent subject for enlarging the boundaries of species
and varieties. The collections in this department were referred
to members of the Lyceum of Natural History at New York, and
of the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia. The results
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
of their examinations have been published in two of the principal
scientific journals of the country. It had been originally proposed
to republish these papers in this Appendix, together with that
on the botanical collections, and some other topics; but the long
time that has elapsed, renders it, on second thought, inexpedient.
Distinct references to the several papers are given.</p>

<h4>XII.<br />
<i>A Letter embracing Notices of the Zoology of the Northwest.</i></h4>

<p class="center">
By <span class="smcap">Henry R. Schoolcraft</span>.</p>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Vernon</span>, N.Y., October 27, 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span> I reached this place, on my return from the sources
of the Mississippi River, on the 21st instant, having left the canal
at Oneida Creek at four o'clock in the morning, whence I footed
it three miles through the forest, by a very muddy road, to the
ancient location of Oneida Castle, while my baggage was carried
by a man on horseback.</p>

<p>The plan of the expedition embraced the circumnavigation of
the coasts of Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior. From the
head of the latter, we ascended the rapid River of St. Louis to a
summit which descends west to the Upper Mississippi, the waters
of which we entered about five hundred miles above the Falls of
St. Anthony, and some three hundred miles above the ulterior
point reached with boats by Lieutenant Pike in December, 1805.</p>

<p>From this point we ascended the Mississippi, by its involutions,
to its upper falls at Pakagama, where it dashes over a rock formation.
A vast plateau of grass and aquatic plants succeeds,
through which it winds as in a labyrinth. On this plateau we
encountered and passed across the southern Lake Winnipek.
Beyond this, the stream appears to be but little diminished, unless
it be in its depth. It is eventually traced to a very large lake
called Upper Lac Ceder Rouge, but to which we applied the name
of Cass Lake. This is the apparent navigable source of the river,
and was our terminal point. It lies in latitude 47° 25´ 23´´.</p>

<p>The whole of this summit of the continent is a vast formation
of drift and boulders, deposited in steps. In descending it, we
found the river crossed by the primitive rocks in latitude about
46°, and it enters the great limestone formation by the cataract of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
St. Anthony's Falls, in latitude 44° 58´ 40´´. We descended the
river below this point, by its windings among high and picturesque
cliffs, to the influx of the Wisconsin, estimated to be three hundred
miles. Thence we came through the Wisconsin and Fox
valleys to Green Bay, on an arm of Lake Michigan, and, having
circumnavigated the latter, returned through Lakes Huron and
St. Clair to Detroit. The line of travel is about four thousand
two hundred miles. Such a country&mdash;for its scenery, its magnificence,
and resources, and the strong influence it is destined ultimately
to have on the commerce, civilization, and progress of the
country&mdash;the sun does not shine on! Its topography, latitudes
and longitudes, heights and distances, have been accurately obtained
by Captain Douglass, of West Point, who will prepare an
elaborate map and description of the country.</p>

<p>Personally, I have not been idle. If I have sat sometimes, in
mute wonder, gazing on such scenes as the Pictured Rocks of
Lake Superior, or the sylvan beauty and mixed abruptness of the
Falls of St. Anthony, it has been but the idleness of admiration.
I have kept my note book, my sketch-book, and my pencil in my
hands, early and late; nor have once, during the whole journey,
transferred myself, at an early hour, from the camp-fire or pallet
to the canoe, merely to recompose myself again to sleep. If the
mineralogy or geology of the country often presented little to note,
the scenery, or the atmosphere, or that lone human boulder, the
American Indian, did. The evidences of the existence of copper
in the basin of Lake Superior are ample. There is every indication
of its abundance that the geologist could wish. Nature
here has operated on a grand scale. By means of volcanic fires,
she has infused into the trap-rocks veins of melted metal, which
not inaptly represent the arteries of the human system; for
wherever the broken-down shores of this lake are examined, they
disclose, not the sulphurets and carbonates of this ore, but fragments
and lumps of virgin veins. These, the winds and waves
have scattered far and wide.</p>

<p>But what, you will ask, can be reported of its quadrupeds,
birds, reptilia, and general zoology? Have you measured the
height and length of the mastodon&mdash;"the great bull"&mdash;who the
Indians told Mr. Jefferson resisted the thunderbolts, and leaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
over the great lakes?<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[252]</a> Truly, I beg you to spare me on this
head. You are aware that we had no professed zoologist.</p>

<p>I herewith inclose you a list of such animals as came particularly
under our notice. Imperfect as it is, it will give you the
general facts. The dried and stuffed skins of such species as
were deemed to be undescribed, or were otherwise worthy attention,
will be transmitted for description. Among these is a species
of squirrel, of peculiar character, from the vicinity of St. Peter's,
together with a species of mus, a burrowing animal, which is
very destructive to vegetation. This appears to be the hamster
of Georgia. Of the larger class of quadrupeds, we met, in the
forest traversed, the black bear, deer, elk, and buffalo. The
latter we encountered in large numbers, about one hundred and
fifty miles above the Falls of St. Anthony, about latitude 45°, on
the east bank of the river. We landed for the chase, and had a
full opportunity of observing its size, color, gait, and general
appearance.</p>

<p>Great interest was imparted to portions of the tour by the
ornithology of the country, and it only required the interest and
skill in this line of a Wilson or an Audubon, to have not only
identified, but also added to the list of species.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[253]</a></p>

<p>The geological character of the country has been found highly
interesting. The primitive rocks rise up in high orbicular groups
on the banks of Lake Superior. The interstices between groups
are filled up with coarse red, gray, or mottled sandstone, which
lies, generally, in a horizontal position, but is sometimes waved
or raised up vertically. Volcanic fires have played an important
part here. I have been impressed with the fact that the granitical
series are generally deficient in mica, its place being supplied by
hornblende. Indeed, the rock is more truly sienite, very little
true granite being found, and, in these cases, it is in the form of
veins or beds in the sienite.</p>

<p>There have also been great volcanic fires and upliftings under
the sources of the Mississippi. Greenstone and trap are piled up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
in huge boulders. The most elevated rock, in place, on the
sources of the Mississippi, is found to be quartzite. This is at
the Falls of Pakagama. In coming down the Mississippi, soon
after passing the latitude of 46°, the river is found to have its
bed on greenstones and sienites, till reaching near to the Falls of
St. Anthony, where the great western horizontal limestone series
begins. To facilitate the study of the latter, opportunities were
sought of detecting its imbedded forms of organic life, but their
infrequency, and the rapid mode of our journeying, was averse
to much success in this line without the boundaries of the great
lake basins.</p>

<p>In the department of mineralogy, I have not as brilliant a collection
as I brought from Potosi in 1819&mdash;but, nevertheless, one
of value&mdash;the country explored being a wilderness, and very little
labor having been applied in excavations. Among the objects
secured, I have fine specimens of the various forms of native
copper and its ores, together with crystallized sulphurets of lead,
zinc, and iron; native muriate of soda, graphite, sulphate of lime,
and strontian, and the attractive forms which the species of the
quartz family assume, in the shore debris of the lakes, under the
names of agate, carnelian, &amp;c. The whole will be prepared and
elaborately reported to the Department.</p>

<p>I found the freshwater shells of this region to be a very attractive
theme of observation in places</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Where the tiger steals along,</p>
<p>And the dread Indian chants his dismal song;"</p>
</div></div>

<p>where, indeed, there was scarcely anything else to attract attention;
and I have collected a body of bivalves, which will be forwarded
to our mutual friend, Dr. Mitchell, for description. Indeed,
the present communication is designed, after you have perused
it, to pass under his eye. No one in our scientific ranks is more
alive to the progress of discovery in all its physical branches.
Governor Clinton, in one of his casual letters, has very happily
denominated him the Delphic oracle, for all who have a question
to ask come to him, and his scientific memory and research, in
books, old and new, are such, that it must be a hard question indeed
which he cannot solve.</p>

<p>Next to him, as an expounder of knowledge, you, my dear sir,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
as the representative of the <i>corps editorial</i>, take your place. For,
if it is the writer of books who truly increases information, every
decade's experience more and more convinces me that it is the
editor of a diurnal journal who diffuses it, by his brief critical
notices, or by giving a favorable or unfavorable impetus to public
opinion.</p>

<p>I am expected, I find, to publish my private narrative of the
expedition, to serve at least&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;as a stay to popular
expectation, until the more matured results can be duly
elaborated. I am taking breath here, among my friends, for a
few days, and shall be greatly governed by your judgment in
the matter, after my arrival at Albany.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philological Note.</span>&mdash;Three of these fifty-seven terms of Indian nomenclature are
monosyllables, and twenty-four dissyllables. The latter are compounds, as in <i>muk-wah</i>
(black animal), and <i>wau-bose</i> (white little animal); and it is inferable that all
the names over a single syllable are compounds. Thus, aisebun (raccoon), is from
<i>ais</i>, a shell, and the term past tense of verbs in <i>bun</i>.</p>

<p>The squirrel [from the vicinity of the Falls of St. Anthony], is
a species not heretofore described, and has been named <i>sciurus
tredecem striatus</i>, or the federation squirrel. (A.)</p>

<p>The pouched rat, or <i>mus busarius</i>, has been seen but once in
Europe. This was a specimen sent to the British Museum from
Canada, and described by Dr. Shaw. But its existence is rather
questioned by Chev. Cuvier. Both animals have been described,
and the descriptions published in the 21st vol. of the <i>Medical Repository</i>,
of New York, pp. 248, 249. The specimens [from the
West] are both preserved in my museum. Drawings have been
executed by the distinguished artist Milbert, and forwarded by
him, at my request, to the administrators of the King's Museum,
at Paris, of which he is a corresponding member. My descriptions
accompany them. The animals are retained as too valuable
to be sent out of the country. [B.]</p>

<p>The paddle-fish is the <i>spatularia</i> of Shaw, and <i>polydon</i> of Lacepede.
It lives in the Mississippi only, and the skeleton, though
incomplete, is better than any other person here possesses. It is
carefully preserved in my collection.</p>

<p>The serpent is a species of the ophalian genus anguis, the oveto
of the French, and the blind worm of the English. The loss of
the tail of this fragile creature renders an opinion a little dubious;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
but it is supposed to be <i>opthiosaureus</i> of Dandrige, corresponding
to the <i>anguis ventralis</i> of Linnæus, figured by Catesby.</p>

<p>The shells afford a rich amount of an undescribed species. The
whole of the univalves and bivalves received from Messrs. Schoolcraft
and Douglass have been assembled and examined, with all
I possessed before, and with Mr. Stacy Collins's molluscas brought
from the Ohio. Mr. Barnes is charged with describing and delineating
all the species not contained in Mr. Say's <i>Memoir of the
Productions of the Land and Fresh Waters of North America</i>. The
finished work will be laid before the Lyceum, and finally be
printed in Mr. Silliman's <i>New Haven Journal</i>. The species by
which geology will be enriched will amount, probably, to nine or
ten. (C.) We shall endeavor to be just to our friends and benefactors.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">(A.)</p>

<p>An animal similar, in some respects, has been subsequently
found on the Straits of St. Mary's, Michigan, a specimen of the
dried skin of which I presented to the National Institute at
Washington; but, from the absence of the head bones and teeth,
it is not easy to determine whether it is a sciurus, or arctomys.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">(B.)</p>

<p>The duplicature of the cheeks of this animal having been extended
<i>outwardly</i> in drying the skin, was left in its rigid state,
giving it an unnatural appearance, which doubtless led to the incredulity
of Cuvier when he saw the figure and description of Dr.
Shaw. Dr. Mitchell was led to a similar error of opinion, at first,
as to the natural position of these bags; but afterwards, when the
matter was explained to him, corrected this mistaken notion.</p>

<p class="sub-subsection">(C.)</p>

<p>By reference to the descriptions of Mr. Barnes and Mr. Lea,
recited above, the number will be seen to have exceeded this
estimate.</p>

<i>Memoranda of Climatic Phenomena and the Distribution of Solar
Heat in 1820.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry R. Schoolcraft</span>.</h4>

<p>The influence of solar heat on the quantity of water which is
discharged from the great table lands which give origin to the
sources of the Mississippi was such, during the summer months
of 1820, that, on reaching those altitudes in latitude but a few
minutes north of 47°, on the 21st of July, it was found impracticable
to proceed higher in tracing out its sources. Attention had
been directed to the phenomena of temperatures, clouds, evaporations,
and solar influences, from the opening of the year, but they
were not prosecuted with all the advantages essential to generalization.
Still, some of the details noticed merit attention as meteorological
memoranda which may be interesting in future researches
of this kind, and it is with no higher view that these selections
are made.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the fluctuations of temperature noticed
at lower points on the lake chain, about the latitude of Michilimackinac,
have also characterized the entire length of Lake Superior.
The atmosphere observed at three separate times, during
twenty-four days, by Fahrenheit's thermometer, during the
months of June and July, has varied from an average temperature
of 62° to 88°, agreeable to masses of clouds interposed to
the rays of the sun, and to shifting currents of wind, which have
often suddenly intervened. Its waters, spreading for a length of
five hundred miles from E. to W., observed during the same time
by as many immersions of the instrument, has not varied more
than two degrees below or above the average temperature of 55°
in mere surface observations.</p>

<p>Nor does it appear that the same quantity of snow falls in the
Missouri Valley which is common east of the Alleghany Mountains.
At the Council Bluffs, on the last of January, snow was
but twelve inches deep; at the same period, it was three feet or
more throughout the Eastern States.</p>

<p>A snow-storm fell over the middle and eastern latitudes of the
United States, for the first time, during the autumn of the year
(1820), in the first half of November. As a precursor to this,
slight drifts and gusts of snow had showed themselves at Albany
on the 25th, 26th, and 28th of October.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[266]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Montreal, Canada</span>, October 28, 1820.&mdash;On Wednesday last
we had the first fall of snow this season. It commenced in the
forenoon, and continued slightly during the remainder of the
day. Although expected to disappear, the frosts in the nights
have been pretty severe, and a considerable quantity still remains
(Saturday) at the moment we are writing."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Salem, N. Y.</span> October 31.&mdash;On Saturday last (27th), we had
our first snow for the season. It fell during most of the forenoon,
and for an hour or two the atmosphere was quite filled
with it. Some cool and shaded spots still remain whitened,
though yesterday was one of our pleasant autumnal days, with a
mild west wind."</p>

<p><i>Early Sleighing.</i>&mdash;The <i>Burlington</i> (Vt.) <i>Sentinel</i> of the 27th ult.
says: "On Tuesday night and Wednesday, the snow fell in this
place about eight inches deep on the level. It is said to be twelve
inches deep in some of the adjoining towns."&mdash;<i>October, 1820.</i></p>

<p>At Philadelphia, it began on Saturday, 11th (morning), snow-storm
from the east, and continued all day. At night a hurricane,
accompanied by torrents of rain and snow, which did not
subside until the 12th in the morning. Weather unsettled on
the 13th.</p>

<p>At Worcester, a severe snow-storm, from northeast, on the 11th
and 12th. On the 13th, snow was ten inches deep, the weather
cold, and sleighing good.</p>

<p>Snow in Poughkeepsie fell twelve inches deep, and produced
excellent sleighing.</p>

<p>At New Haven (Conn.), it began with snow, hail, and rain, on
Saturday evening, 11th. The day before was wintery cold. The
storm continued, without intermission, till Monday, 13th.</p>

<p>At Boston, it also began on Saturday, 11th, from the northeast,
and fell six inches. On Sunday, rain and snow. Monday cold,
and indifferent sleighing in the <i>streets</i>.&mdash;<i>Boston paper</i>, Nov. 14th.</p>

<p>In Vernon, Oneida County, it began on the 11th, in the evening,
and continued, in all, till Monday, 13th, giving us snow, rain,
hail, and wind, alternately. On the 15th, the snow, which lay
six inches deep, began to thaw, and this was the beginning of our
Indian summer.</p>

<p>The Buffalo papers, of November 14th, say that several vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
were lost in the gale and snow-storm, or driven ashore. The
storm closed up on the 13th, at New York City; the wind at
northwest, and very cold. The rain, snow, and hail which had
fallen gave good sleighing a part of that day. These notices
cover an area of about five hundred miles square, proving, the
universality of our autumnal phenomena.</p>

<p class="subsection"><i>Indian Summer.</i></p>

<p>This season appears to be produced by the settling of a thin
azure vapor. It is supposed to arise from the partial decomposition
of the foliage of the forest after the autumnal rains are past.
"What is called the Indian summer," says an observer at Albany,
"usually gives us fifteen or twenty days of uncommonly pleasant
fall weather, commencing in the early part of October. The present
season it set in as usual, and we had a week or ten days of
very fine weather, when a northeast storm commenced, and continued
for part of two days; within which time more rain is supposed
to have fallen than during the whole of the preceding summer
and fall. Most of the streams and springs were filled, and
the Hudson River, in many places, overflowed its banks. It
however again cleared off pleasant, and remained so till Tuesday
evening, when another storm of rain commenced, which continued
the whole night. In the morning, there was some fall of hail accompanying
the rain, and about 8 o'clock a slight flurry of snow,
and another on Thursday evening; since which the weather has
set in cold, and has the appearance of the closing in of fall or the
setting in of winter. We however expect to put off winter and
cold weather for some time yet, and anticipate many pleasant
days in November."</p>

<p>Indian summer, in Oneida, commenced on the 15th November.
The weather had previously been cold, with snow and rain and a
murky atmosphere.</p>

<p>Dr. Freeman, of Boston, in one of his occasional sermons, employs
the following poetic language in relation to this American
phenomenon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The southwest is the pleasantest wind which blows in New
England. In the month of October, in particular, after the frosts
which commonly take place at the end of September, it frequently
produces two or three weeks of fair weather, in which the air is
perfectly transparent, and clouds, which float in a sky of the purest
azure, are adorned with brilliant colors. If at this season a man
of an affectionate heart and ardent imagination should visit the
tombs of his friends, the southwestern breezes, as they breathe
through the glowing trees, would seem to him almost articulate.
Though he might not be so wrapped in enthusiasm as to fancy
that the spirits of his ancestors were whispering in his ear, yet
he would at least imagine that he heard 'the still small voice' of
God. This charming season is called the Indian Summer, a name
which is derived from the natives, who believe that it is caused
by a wind which comes immediately from the court of their great
and benevolent God Cantantowan, or the Southwestern God; the
God who is superior to all other beings, who sends them every
blessing which they enjoy, and to whom the souls of their fathers
go after their decease."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging indent"><i>Pictographic Mode of Communicating Ideas among the Northwestern
Indians, observed during the Expedition to the Sources of the Mississippi
in 1820, in a Letter to the Secretary of War.</i> By Hon.
<span class="smcap">Lewis Cass</span>.</p>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, February 2, 1821.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> An incident occurred upon my recent tour to the Northwest,
so rare in itself, and which so clearly shows the facility with
which communications may be opened between savage nations,
without the intervention of letters, that I have thought it not improper
to communicate it to you.</p>

<p>The Chippewas and Sioux are hereditary enemies, and Charlevoix
says they were at war when the French first reached the
Mississippi. I endeavored, when among them, to learn the cause
which first excited them to war, and the time when it commenced.
But they can give no rational account. An intelligent Chippewa
chief informed me that the disputed boundary between them was
a subject of little importance, and that the question respecting it
could be easily adjusted. He appeared to think that they fought
because their fathers fought before them. This war has been
waged with various success, and, in its prosecution, instances of
courage and self-devotion have occurred, within a few years, which
would not have disgraced the pages of Grecian or of Roman history.
Some years since, mutually weary of hostilities, the chiefs
of both nations met and agreed upon a truce. But the Sioux,
disregarding the solemn compact which they had formed, and
actuated by some sudden impulse, attacked the Chippewas, and
murdered a number of them. The old Chippewa chief who descended
the Mississippi with us was present upon this occasion, and
his life was saved by the intrepidity and generous self-devotion of
a Sioux chief. This man entreated, remonstrated, and threatened.
He urged his countrymen, by every motive, to abstain from any
violation of their faith, and, when he found his remonstrances
useless, he attached himself to this Chippewa chief, and avowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
his determination of saving or perishing with him. Awed by his
intrepidity, the Sioux finally agreed that he should ransom the
Chippewa, and he accordingly applied to this object all the property
he owned. He then accompanied the Chippewa on his
journey until he considered him safe from any parties of the
Sioux who might be disposed to follow him.</p>

<p>I subjoin an extract from the journal of Mr. Doty, an intelligent
young gentleman who was with the expedition. This extract
has already been published, but it may have escaped your observation,
and the incident which it describes is so heroic in itself,
and so illustrative of the Indian character, that I cannot resist the
temptation of transmitting it to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extract from Mr. Doty's Journal.</span>&mdash;"The Indians of the
upper country consider those of the Fond du Lac as very stupid
and dull, being but little given to war. They count the Sioux
their enemies, but have heretofore made few war excursions.</p>

<p>"Having been frequently reprimanded by some of the more
vigilant Indians of the north, and charged with cowardice, and
an utter disregard for the event of the war, thirteen men of this
tribe, last season, determined to retrieve the character of their
nation by making an excursion against the Sioux. Accordingly,
without consulting the other Indians, they secretly departed, and
penetrated far into the Sioux country. Unexpectedly, at night,
they came upon a party of the Sioux, amounting to near one
hundred men, and immediately began to prepare for battle. They
encamped a short distance from the Sioux, and, during the night,
dug holes in the ground into which they might retreat and fight
to the last extremity. They appointed one of their number (the
youngest) to take a station at a distance and witness the struggle,
and instructed him, when they were all slain, to make his escape
to their own land, and state the circumstances under which they
had fallen.</p>

<p>"Early in the morning, they attacked the Sioux in their camp,
who, immediately sallying out upon them, forced them back to
the last place of retreat they had resolved upon. They fought
desperately. More than twice their own number were killed
before they lost their lives. Eight of them were tomahawked in
the holes to which they had retreated; the other four fell on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>field! The <span class="smcap">THIRTEENTH</span> returned home, according to the directions
be had received, and related the foregoing circumstances
to his tribe. They mourned their death; but, delighted with the
bravery of their friends, unexampled in modern times, they were
happy in their grief.</p>

<p>"This account I received of the very Indian who was of the
party and had escaped."</p>

<p>The Sioux are much more numerous than the Chippewas, and
would have overpowered them long since had the operations of
the former been consentaneous. But they are divided into so
many different bands, and are scattered over such an extensive
country, that their efforts have no regular combination.</p>

<p>Believing it equally consistent with humanity and sound policy
that these border contests should not be suffered to continue;
satisfied that you would approve of any plan of pacification
which might be adopted, and feeling that the Indians have a full
portion of moral and physical evils, without adding to them the
calamities of a war which had no definite object, and no probable
termination; on our arrival at Sandy Lake, I proposed to the
Chippewa chiefs that a deputation should accompany us to the
mouth of the St. Peter's, with a view to establish a permanent
peace between them and the Sioux. The Chippewas readily
acceded to this proposition, and ten of their principal men descended
the Mississippi with us.</p>

<p>The computed distance from Sandy Lake to the St. Peter's is
six hundred miles, and, as I have already had the honor to inform
you, a considerable proportion of the country has been the theatre
of hostile enterprises. The Mississippi here traverses the immense
plains which extend to the Missouri, and which present to the
eye a spectacle at once interesting and fatiguing. Scarcely the
slightest variation in the surface occurs, and they are entirely
destitute of timber. In this debatable land, the game is very
abundant; buffaloes, elks, and deer range unharmed, and unconscious
of harm. The mutual hostilities of the Chippewas and
Sioux render it dangerous for either, unless in strong parties, to
visit this portion of the country. The consequence has been a
great increase of all the animals whose flesh is used for food, or
whose fur is valuable for market. We found herds of buffaloes
quietly feeding upon the plains. There is little difficulty in approaching
sufficiently near to kill them. With an eagerness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
which is natural to all hunters, and with an improvidence which
always attends these excursions, the animal is frequently killed
without any necessity, and no other part of them is preserved
but the tongue.</p>

<p>There is something extremely novel and interesting in this
pursuit. The immense plains, extending as far as the eye can
reach, are spotted here and there with droves of buffaloes. The
distance and the absence of known objects render it difficult to
estimate the size or the number of these animals. The hunters
approach cautiously, keeping to the leeward, lest the buffaloes,
whose scent is very acute, should observe them. The moment a
gun is fired, the buffaloes scatter and scour the field in every
direction. Unwieldy as they appear, they move with considerable
celerity. It is difficult to divert them from their course, and
the attempt is always hazardous. One of our party barely escaped
with his life from this act of temerity. The hunters, who are
stationed upon different parts of the plain, fire as the animals
pass them. The repeated discharge of guns in every direction,
the shouts of those who are engaged in the pursuit, and the sight
of the buffaloes at full speed on every side, give an animation to
the scene which is rarely equalled.</p>

<p>The droves which we saw were comparatively small. Some of
the party whom we found at St. Peter's, and who arrived at that
place by land from the Council Bluffs, estimated one of the droves
which they saw to contain two thousand buffaloes.</p>

<p>As we approached this part of the country, our Chippewa
friends became cautious and observing. The flag of the United
States was flying upon all our canoes, and, thanks to the character
which our country acquired by the events of the last war, I found
in our progress through the whole Indian country, after we had
once left the great line of communication, that this flag was a
passport which rendered our journey safe. We consequently felt
assured that no wandering party of the Sioux would attack even
their enemies, while under our protection. But the Chippewas
could not appreciate the influence which the American flag would
have upon other nations, nor is it probable that they estimated
with much accuracy the motives which induced us to assume the
character of an umpire.</p>

<p>The Chippewas landed occasionally to examine whether any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
of the Sioux had recently visited that quarter. In one of these
excursions, a Chippewa found in a conspicuous place, a piece of
birch bark, made flat by being fastened between two sticks at
each end, and about eighteen inches long by fifteen broad. This
bark contained the answer of the Sioux nation to the proposition
which had been made by the Chippewas for the termination of
hostilities. So sanguinary has been the contest between these
tribes, that no personal communication could take place. Neither
the sanctity of the office, nor the importance of the message, could
protect the ambassadors of either party from the vengeance of
each other. Some time preceding, the Chippewas, anxious for
the restoration of peace, had sent a number of their young men
into these plains with a similar piece of bark, upon which they
had represented their desire. The bark had been left hanging to
a tree in an exposed situation, and had been found and taken away
by a party of the Sioux.</p>

<p>The propositions had been examined and discussed in the Sioux
villages, and the bark which we found contained their answer.
The Chippewa who had prepared the bark for his tribe was
with us, and on our arrival at St. Peter's, finding it was lost, I
requested him to make another. He did so, and produced what
I have no doubt was a perfect <i>fac-simile</i>. We brought with us
both of these <i>projets</i>, and they are now in the hands of Capt.
Douglass. He will be able to give a more intelligible description
of them than I can from recollection, and they could not be in
the possession of one more competent to the task.</p>

<p>The Chippewas explained to us with great facility the intention
of the Sioux, and apparently with as much readiness as if
some common character had been established between them.</p>

<p>The junction of the St. Peter's with the Mississippi, where a
principal part of the Sioux reside, was represented, and also the
American fort, with a sentinel on duty, and the flag flying. The
principal Sioux chief is named the Six, alluding, I believe, to the
bands or villages under his influence. To show that he was not
present at the deliberations upon the subject of peace, he was
represented upon a smaller piece of bark, which was attached to
the other. To identify him, he was drawn with six heads and a
large medal. Another Sioux chief stood in the foreground, holding
the pipe of peace in his right hand, and his weapons in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
left. Even we could not misunderstand that. Like our own eagle
with the olive-branch and arrows, he was desirous of peace, but
prepared for war.</p>

<p>The Sioux party contained fifty-nine warriors, and this number
was indicated by fifty-nine guns, which were drawn upon one
corner of the bark. The only subject which occasioned any difficulty
in the interpretation of the Chippewas, was owing to an
incident, of which they were ignorant. The encampment of our
troops had been removed from the low grounds upon the St.
Peter's, to a high hill upon the Mississippi; two forts were therefore
drawn upon the bark, and the solution of this enigma could
not be discovered till our arrival at St. Peter's.</p>

<p>The effect of the discovery of this bark upon the minds of the
Chippewas was visible and immediate. Their doubts and apprehensions
appeared to be removed, and during the residue of the
journey, their conduct and feelings were completely changed.</p>

<p>The Chippewa bark was drawn in the same general manner,
and Sandy Lake, the principal place of their residence, was represented
with much accuracy. To remove any doubt respecting it,
a view was given of the old northwest establishment, situated
upon its shore, and now in the possession of the American Fur
Company. No proportion was preserved in their attempt at delineation.
One mile of the Mississippi, including the mouth of
the St. Peter's, occupied as much space as the whole distance to
Sandy Lake; nor was there anything to show that one part was
nearer to the spectator than another; yet the object of each party
was completely obtained. Speaking languages radically different
from each, for the Sioux constitute one of three grand divisions
into which the early French writers have arranged the aborigines
of our country, while the Chippewas are a branch of what they
call Algonquins, and without any conventional character established
between them, these tribes thus opened a communication
upon the most important subject which could occupy their attention.
Propositions leading to a peace were made and accepted,
and the simplicity of the mode could only be equalled by the
distinctness of the representations, and by the ease with which
they were understood.</p>

<p>An incident like this, of rare occurrence at this day, and throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>some light upon the mode of communication before the invention
of letters, I thought it not improper to communicate to
you. It is only necessary to add, that on our arrival at St. Peter's,
we found Col. Leavenworth had been as attentive and indefatigable
upon this subject, as upon every other which fell within the sphere
of his command.</p>

<p>During the preceding winter, he had visited a tribe of the
Chippewas upon this pacific mission, and had, with the aid of
the agent, Mr. Talliafero, prepared the minds of both tribes for a
permanent peace. The Sioux and Chippewas met in council, at
which we all attended, and smoked the pipe of peace together.
They then, as they say in their figurative language, buried the
tomahawk so deep that it could never be dug up again, and our
Chippeway friends departed well satisfied with the result of their
mission.</p>

<p>I trust that Mr. Bolvin, the agent at Prairie du Chien, has been
able before this to communicate to you a successful account of the
negotiation which I instructed him to open between the Sacs and
Foxes, forming one party, and the Sioux. Hostilities were carried
on between these tribes, which, I presume, he has been able
to terminate.</p>

<p>We discovered a remarkable coincidence, as well in the sound
as in the application, between a word in the Sioux language and
one in our own. The circumstance is so singular that I deem it
worthy of notice. The Sioux call the Falls of St. Anthony <span class="smcap">Ha ha</span>,
and the pronunciation is in every respect similar to the same words
in the English language. I could not learn that this word was
used for any other purpose, and I believe it is confined in its
application to that place alone.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[267]</a> The traveller in ascending the
Mississippi turns a projecting point, and these falls suddenly appear
before him at a short distance. Every man, savage or civilized,
must be struck with the magnificent spectacle which opens
to his view. There is an assemblage of objects which, added to
the solitary grandeur of the scene, to the height of the cataract,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>and to the eternal roar of its waters, inspire the spectator with
awe and admiration.</p>

<p>In his <i>Anecdotes of Painting</i>, it is stated by Horace Walpole,
that "on the invention of fosses for boundaries, the common people
called them Ha Ha's! to express their surprise on finding a sudden
and unperceived check to their walk." I believe the word is
yet used in this manner in England. It is certainly not a little
remarkable that the same word should be thus applied by one of
the most civilized and by one of the most barbarous people, to
objects which, although not the same, were yet calculated to excite
the admiration of the observer.</p>

<p>Nothing can show more clearly how fallacious are those deductions
of comparative etymology, which are founded upon a few words
carefully gleaned here and there from languages having no
common origin, and which are used by people who have neither
connection nor intercourse. The common descent of two nations
can never be traced by the accidental consonance of a few syllables
or words, and the attempt must lead us into the regions of
fancy.</p>

<p>The Sioux language is probably one of the most barren which
is spoken by any of our aboriginal tribes. Colonel Leavenworth,
who made considerable proficiency in it, calculated, I believe, that
the number of words did not exceed one thousand. They use
more gestures in their conversation than any Indians I have seen,
and this is a necessary result of the poverty of their language.</p>

<p>I am well aware, that the subject of this letter is not within the
ordinary sphere of official communications. But I rely for your
indulgence upon the interest which you have shown to procure
and disseminate a full knowledge of every subject connected with
the internal condition of our country.</p>

<p>I am preparing a memoir upon the present state of the Indians,
agreeably to the intimation in my letter of September last. I
shall finish and transmit it to you as soon as my other duties will
permit.</p>

<h4>XXI.<br />
Inquiries respecting the History of the Indians of the United States.
By <span class="smcap">Lewis Cass</span>.</h4>

<p>These queries were published at Detroit in separate pamphlets,
about the era of 1822, and communicated to persons in the Indian
country supposed to be capable of furnishing the desired information.
The results became the topic of several critical disquisitions,
which appeared in the pages of the <i>North American Review</i> in
1825 and 1826; disquisitions the spirit and tone of which created,
as the reader who is posted up on the topic will remember, a sensation
among philological and philosophical readers.</p>

<p>Whether we are most to admire the bold tone of inquiry assumed
by Gen. Cass, the acumen displayed in the discussions, the
eloquence of the language, or the general soundness of the positions
taken, is the only question left for decision. Certainly,
nobody can arise from the perusal of these papers without becoming
wiser or better informed on the subjects discussed. The
mere luxury of high-toned and eloquent language is a gratification
to the inquirer. But he cannot close these investigations
into a subject of deep historical and philological interest without
feeling established in the principles of historic truth, or warmed
in his literary ardor.</p>

<p>Prominent among the topics of the initial discussion, was the
work of John Dunn Hunter, a singular adventurer in the Indian
country, or, perhaps, an early captive, who, after wandering to the
Atlantic cities, where his harmless inefficiency of character gained
no favorable attention, found his way to London, where the
booksellers concocted a book of travels from him, in which the
United States is unscrupulously traduced for its treatment of the
Indians. The scathing which this person and his book received
arises from its having fallen in the way of the business journeys
of the critic to visit some of the principal scenes referred to; and
among others, the residence of John Dunn, of Missouri, after
whom he professed to be named, who utterly denied all knowledge
of the man or of his purported adventures.</p>

<p>The question of the authenticity of the Indian traditions of Mr.
Heckewelder, derived from a single tribe, and that tribe telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
stories to salve up its own disastrous history, and the mere literary
capacities of the man to put his materials in order, is propounded
and examined in connection with the contemporary traditions and
languages of other tribes. These traditions had been communicated
to the Pennsylvania Historical Society, in 1816, and were
published under the special auspices of Mr. Duponceau, in 1819.
From the internal evidence of the letters themselves, the critic pronounces
them to be reproductions of Mr. Duponceau himself; and
it is an evidence of the aptness of this deduction to be told that
Mr. Gallatin admitted (<i>vide</i> my <i>Personal Memoirs</i>, p. 623), that the
letters of Mr. Heckewelder had all been rewritten previous to
publication. It could no longer be a subject of admiration to
philologists, that from such imperfect sources of information, that
distinguished scholar should have pronounced the opinion that
the Delaware language rather exceeds than falls short of the Greek
and Latin in the affluence of syntactical forms and capacities of
expression. <i>Trans. Hist. and Lit. Com., Am. Philo. Soc.</i>, vol. i. p. 415.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
A man has published, in 1816, an octavo volume in Trenton
(United States), the author's name Boudinot, to explain some
things about the Indian nations, and, among other things, he fancies
some resemblance between their languages and Hebrew.
Baron Von Humboldt, a Prussian, was in Spanish America lately,
and he found the natives had Hebrew opinions and usages, evidently
things borrowed from Jewish doctrines. I don't want you
to inquire much about their being of this extraction, but observe,
for me, whether their languages have no pronouns, as one author,
Colden, stated fifty years ago; and whether they are defective in
the prepositions, as this Boudinot states; and whether those near
you have any words, idioms, or traditions that are expressive of
their early origin, or their connection with European nations.</p>

<p>In fact, I think you are better circumstanced, in most respects,
than any other man that I ever heard of, to do something worth
notice in that way; for, although you have not books, nor knowledge
of many tongues, yet you could collect lists of great and
radical words, expressed with proper letters, so that others could
compare those words with Asiatic, and African, and European
tongues, so as to enable mankind to judge of similitudes or dissimilitudes.</p>

<p>The words most apt to pervade different nations, and to pass
from one people to another, are articles, pronouns, auxiliary verbs,
prepositions; next to these, numerals; next to these, whatever
terms are expressive of striking, useful, hurtful, or very clear and
definite objects and ideas; for, if the conceptions we have of
things be not very definite, clear, and distinct, the idea and the
word are not likely to float down the stream of time together, they
will be jostled and separated. Be very careful in spelling the
Indian words; spell them in different ways, where our letters
don't square exactly with their sounds. Take notice of their
musical tones, and whether these tones get in, as essential parts,
into their speech; and, above all, remember that a <i>word</i> is a <i>thing</i>,
and that it may be examined as a <i>record</i>, or considered like a
coin or medal, as well as if it had the stamp of a king or mint
upon it.</p>

<p>I will write more if this vessel does not sail to-day. God bless
you and yours, and believe me, in haste, your affectionate cousin.</p>

<p class="hanging indent"><i>Difficulties of Studying the Indian Tongues of the United States.</i>
By Dr. <span class="smcap">Alexander Wolcott</span>, Jr.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolcott will be remembered by the early inhabitants of
Chicago, when that place was still a military post and the site of
an Indian agency, the latter of which trusts he filled. In 1820,
the Pottowattomie tribe of Indians and their confederates&mdash;the
Illinois&mdash;Chippewas, and Ottowas&mdash;possessed the whole surrounding
regions, roving as lords of the prairies. These numerous and
fierce hunter-tribes, who traded their peltries for fineries, had
many horses, loved rum and fine clothes, and despised all restraints,
came in to him, at his agency, as the mouthpiece of the
President, to transact their affairs, and they often lingered for
days and weeks around the place, which gave him a good opportunity
of becoming familiar with their manners, customs, and
history.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolcott was a man of education, of high morals, dignified
manners, and noble sentiments, with decidedly saturnine feelings,
and a keen perception of the ridiculous. Constitutionally averse
to much or labored personal effort, his leisure hours, in this
seclusion from society, were hours devoted to reading and
social converse, and his attention was appropriately called by
Gen. Cass to the "Inquiries," No. 21, above referred to. The
reply which he at length communicated was written in so
happy a vein, that I obtained permission to publish the substance
of it, in 1824, in my <i>Travels in the Central Portions of
the Mississippi Valley</i>, p. 381. It declares an important truth,
which all must concur in, who have attempted the study of the
Indian languages, for they are required to perform the prior
labor of ascertaining and generalizing the principles of their
accidence and concord. When I first came to St. Mary's, in 1822,
and began the study of the Chippewa, I asked in vain the simple
question how the plural was formed. It was formed, in truth, in
twelve different ways, agreeably to the vowels of terminal syllables;
but this could not be declared until quires of paper had
been written over, the whole vocabulary explored, and days and
nights devoted to it. My first interpreter could not tell a verb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
from a noun, and was incapable of translating the simplest sentence
literally. Besides his ignorance, he was so great a liar that
I never knew when to believe him. He sometimes told the Indians
the reverse of what I said, and often told me the reverse of
what they said.</p>

<span class="smcap">Sault Ste. Marie</span>, May 31, 1823.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir:</span> In order to answer your inquiries, I have improved my
leisure hours, during the part of the summer following our arrival
here (6th July last), and the entire winter and spring, in examining
the words and forms of expression of the Chippewa, or (as the
Indians pronounce it) Odjibwa, tongue. I have found, as I anticipated,
my most efficient aid, in this inquiry, in Mr. Johnston,
and the several members of his intelligent family; my public interpreter
being too unprecise and profoundly ignorant of the rules
of grammar to be of much use in the investigation. Mr. Johnston,
as you are aware, perhaps, came from the north of Ireland,
where his connections are highly respectable, during the first
term of General Washington's administration. He brought letters
from high sources to the Governor-General of Canada; but having,
while at Montreal, fallen in with Don Andrew Tod, a countryman,
who had the monopoly of the fur trade of Louisiana, in
a spirit of enterprise and adventure, he threw himself into that,
at the time, fascinating pursuit, and visited Michilimackinac.
Circumstances determined him to fix his residence at St. Mary's,
where he has resided, making frequent visits to Montreal and
Great Britain, about thirty years. His children have been carefully
instructed in the English language and literature, and the
whole family are familiar with the Indian. Without such proficient
aid, I should have labored against serious impediments at
every step; and, with them, I have found the inquiry, in a philological
point of view, involved in many, and some of them insuperable
difficulties. The results I communicate to you, rather as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
earnest of what may be hereafter done in this matter, than as
completely fulfilling inquiries which it would require Horne

sound of <i>g</i>, which may be represented by <i>gk</i>. Of the mixed
dipthongal and consonental sounds, those most difficult to English
organs are the sounds in <i>aiw</i> and <i>auw</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Letters not used.</i>&mdash;The language is wholly wanting in the
sound of <i>th</i>. It drops the sound of <i>v</i> entirely, substituting <i>b</i>, in
attempts to pronounce foreign words. The sound of <i>l</i> is sometimes
heard in their necromantic chants; but, although it appears
to have been known to the old Algonquin, it is supplied, in the
Odjibwa of this day, exclusively by <i>n</i>. It also eschews the sounds
of <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>x</i>, leaving its simple consonental powers of utterance,
as above denoted, at sixteen. In attempts to pronounce English
words having the sound of <i>f</i>, they substitute <i>p</i>, as in the case of <i>v</i>.
The sound of <i>r</i> is either dropped, or takes the sound of <i>au</i>. Of
the letter <i>x</i> they make no use; the nearest approach I have succeeded
in getting from them is <i>ek-is</i>, showing that it is essentially
a foreign sound to them. The aspirate <i>h</i> begins very few words,
not exceeding five in fifteen hundred, but it is a very frequent
sound in terminals, always following the slender or Latin sound
of <i>a</i>, but never its broad sound in <i>au</i>, or its peculiarly English
sound as heard in the <i>a</i> of <i>may</i>, <i>pay</i>, <i>day</i>. The terminal syllable
of the tribal name (Odjibwa), offers a good evidence of this rule,
this syllable being never sounded by the natives either <i>wah</i> or
<i>wau</i>, but always <i>wa</i>. These rules of utterance appear to be constant
and imperative, and the natives have evidently a nice ear
to discriminate sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
<i>Rule of Euphony.</i>&mdash;In the construction of words, it is required
that a consonant should <i>precede</i> or <i>follow</i> a vowel. In dissyllables
wherein two consonants are sounded in juxtaposition, it happens
from the joining of two syllables, the first of which ends and the
last begins with a consonant, as <i>muk-kuk</i>, a box, and <i>os-sin</i>, a
stone; the utterance in these cases being confluent. But in longer
compounds this juxtaposition is generally avoided by throwing
in a vowel for the sake of euphony, as in the term <i>assinebwoin</i>,
the <i>e</i> in which is a mere connective, and has no meaning by itself.
Nor is it allowable for vowels to follow each other in syllabication,
except in the restricted instances where the being or existence
of a thing or person is affirmed, as in the vowel-words <i>i-e-e</i>
and <i>i-e-a</i>, the animate and inanimate forms of this declaration.
In these cases, there is a distinct accent on each vowel.</p>

<p>4. <i>Accent.</i>&mdash;The accent generally falls on full or broad vowels, and
never on short vowels; such accented vowels are always significant,
and if they are repeated in a compound word, the accents are also
repeated, the only difference being that there are primary and
secondary accents. Thus, in the long descriptive name for a horse,
<i>Pa-bá-zhik-ó-ga-zhé</i>, which is compounded of a numeral term and
two nouns, meaning, the animal with solid hoofs; there are three
accents, the first of which is primary, while the others succeed
each other with decreased intensity. By a table of words which
I have constructed, and had carefully pronounced over by the
natives, it is denoted that dissyllables are generally accented on
the final syllable, trisyllables on the second, and words of four
syllables on the second and fourth. But these indications may
not be constant or universal, as it is perceived that the accents
vary agreeably to the distribution of the full and significant
vowels.</p>

<p>5. <i>Emphasis.</i>&mdash;Stress is laid on particular words in sentences to
which the speaker designs to impart force, and the whole tone of the
entire sentiment and passages is often adapted to convey particular
impressions. This trait more frequently comes out in the private
narrative of real or imaginary scenes, in which the narrator assumes
the very voice and tone of the real or supposed actor. Generally,
in their dealings and colloquial intercourse, there is a significant
stress laid on the terms, <i>meenungaika</i>, certainly; <i>kaigait</i>, truly;
<i>kaugaigo</i>, nothing at all; <i>tiau</i>, behold; <i>woh-ow</i>, who; <i>auwanain</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
were; and other familiar terms of inquiry, denial, or affirmation
in daily use.</p>

<p>6. <i>Conjugation.</i>&mdash;The simplest form in which their verbs are
heard, is in the third person singular of the indicative, as <i>he
speaks</i>, <i>he says</i>, <i>he loves</i>, <i>he dances</i>, or in the first person present
of the imperative. The want of a distinction between the pronouns
<i>he</i> and <i>she</i>, is a defect which the language shares, I believe,
with other very ancient and rude tongues. Conjugations are
effected for persons, tenses, and number, very much as they are in
other rude languages, particularly those of the transpositive class.
The verb is often a single root, or syllable, as <i>saug</i>, love; but
owing to the tendency of adding qualifying particles, their verbs
are cluttered up with other meanings. The word <i>saug</i> is therefore
never heard as an element by itself. In the first place, it
takes before it the pronoun, and in the second place, the object
of action; so that <i>nesaugeau</i>, I love him, or her, or a person, is one
of the simplest of their colloquial phrases. And of this term, the
e, being the fourth syllable, is mere verbiage, means nothing by
itself, and is thrown in for euphony.</p>

<p>Tenses are formed by adding <i>gee</i> to the pronoun for the perfect,
and <i>gah</i> for the future, and <i>gahgee</i> for the second future.
These terms play the part, and supply the want of, auxiliary
verbs. The imperative is made in <i>gah</i>, and the potential in <i>dau</i>
where the second future is <i>daugee</i>. The subjunctive is made
by prefixing the word <i>kishpin</i>, meaning if. The inflection <i>nuh</i>,
asks a question, and as it can be put to all the forms of the
conjugation, it establishes an interrogative mood. The particle
see, negatives the verb, and thus all verbs can be conjugated
positively and negatively.</p>

<p>To constitute the plural, the letter <i>g</i> is added to the conjugations;
thus, <i>nesaugeaug</i> means, I love them. But this is an animate
plural, and can only be added to words of the vital class.
Besides, if the verb or noun to be made plural does not end in
a vowel, but in a consonant, the <i>g</i> cannot be added without interposing
a vowel. It results, therefore, that the vowel class
of words have their plurals in _äg_, <i>eeg</i>, <i>ig</i>, <i>og</i>, or <i>ug</i>. But, if the
class of words be non-vital and numerical, the plural is made
in the letter <i>n</i>. But this letter cannot, as in the other form, be
added, unless the word terminate in a vowel, when the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
plurals are _än_, <i>een</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>on</i>, or <i>un</i>. This simple principle clears up
one cause of perplexity in the conjugations, and denotes a philosophical
method, which divides the whole vocabulary into two
classes; while this provision <i>supersedes</i>, it answers the purpose of
<i>gender</i>. There is, in fact, no gender required by the conjugations,
it being sufficient to denote the <i>vitality</i> or <i>non-vitality</i> of the class.
Nothing can be clearer. This is one of the leading traits of the
grammar of the language, upon the observance of which the best
speakers pride themselves.</p>

<p>It does not, however, result that, because there is no gender
required in the conjugations, the idea of sexuality is unknown to
the nomenclature. Quite the contrary. The tenses for male and
female, in the chief orders of creation, are <i>iaba</i> and <i>nozha</i>. These
words prefixed to the proper names of animals, produce expressions
of precisely the same meaning, and also the same inelegance;
as if we should say, male goose, female goose, male horse, and
female horse, male man and female man. The term for man
(<i>inini</i>) is masculine, and that for woman (<i>equa</i>) feminine in its
construction. It is only in the conjugations that the principle
of gender becomes lost in that of vitality.</p>

<p>7. <i>Active and passive voices.</i>&mdash;The distinction between these two
classes of verbs is made by the inflection <i>ego</i>. By adding this
form to the active verb, its action is reversed, and thrown back
on the nominative. Thus, the verb to carry is <i>nim bemön</i>, I
carry; <i>nim bemön-ego</i>, I am carried. <i>Adowawa</i> is the act of
thumping, as a log by the waves on the shore._ Adowawa-ego_
is a log that is thumped by the waves on shore. <i>Nesaugeah</i>, I
love; <i>Nesaugeigo</i>, I am loved. In the latter phrase, the personal
term <i>au</i> is dropped, and the long sound of <i>e</i> slips into <i>i</i>, which
converts the inflection into <i>igo</i> instead of <i>ego</i>.</p>

<p>8. <i>Participles.</i>&mdash;My impression is, that the Indians are in the
habit of using participles, often to the exclusion of other proper
forms of the verb. The vocabulary contains abundantly the indicative
forms of the verb. To run, to rise, to see, to eat, to tie, to burn,
to strike, to sing, to cry, to dance, are the common terms of parlance;
but as soon as these terms come to be connected with the
action of particular persons, this action appears to be spoken of
as if existing&mdash;both the past and future tenses being thrown away;
and the senses appear to be, I, you, he, or they; running, rising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
seeing, eating, tying, burning, striking, singing, crying, dancing.
At least, I have not been able to convince myself that the action
is not referred to as existing. When the participles should be
used, they, on the contrary, employ the indicative forms, by
which such sentences are made as, he run, he walk, for running,
walking.</p>

<p>The general want of the substantive verb, in their colloquial
phrases, constantly leads to imperfect forms of syntax. Thus,
<i>nëbä</i> is the indicative, first person of the verb to sleep; but
if the term, I am sleeping, be required, the phrase is <i>ne nëbä</i>,
simply, I sleep. So, too, <i>tshägiz</i> is the first person indicative to
burn; but the colloquial phrase, I am burned, or burning, is <i>nen
tshägiz</i>&mdash;the verb remaining in the indicative, and not taking the
participle form.</p>

<p>It is not common to address persons by their familiar names,
as with us&mdash;as John, or James. The very contrary is the usage
of Indian society, the object being to conceal all personal names,
unless they be forced out. If it be required to express this sentence,
namely: Adario has gone out (or temporarily departed),
but will soon return; the equivalent is <i>Ogima</i>, <i>ke mahjaun</i>, <i>panema</i>,
<i>ke takooshin</i>. This sentence literally retranslated is, Chief,
he gone; by and by, he (will) return&mdash;the noun chief being put
for the personal noun Adario. It will be perceived that the pronoun
<i>ke</i> is repeated after the noun, making, chief, he gone.
<i>Panema</i> is an adverb which is undeclinable under all circumstances,
and <i>tahkooshin</i>, the future tense of the verb to arrive,
or come (by land). The phraseology is perfectly loaded with
local or other particulars, which constantly limit the action of
verbs to places, persons, and things.</p>

<h4>I.<br />
<i>Observations on the Grammatical Structure and Flexibility of the
Odjibwa Substantive.</i><a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[270]</a></h4>

<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Inquiry</span> 1.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent">Observations on the Ojibwai substantive. 1. The provision of the language for
indicating gender&mdash;Its general and comprehensive character&mdash;The division of
words into animate and inanimate classes. 2. Number&mdash;its recondite forms,
arising from the terminal vowel in the word. 3. The grammatical forms which
indicate possession, and enable the speaker to distinguish the objective person.</p>

<p>Most of the researches which have been directed to the Indian
languages, have resulted in elucidating the principles governing
the use of the verb, which has been proved to be full and varied
in its inflections. Either less attention has been paid to the other
parts of speech, or results less suited to create high expectations
of their flexibility and powers have been attained. The Indian
verb has thus been made to stand out, as it were in bold relief, as
a shield to defects in the substantive and its accessories, and as,
in fact, compensating, by its multiform appendages of prefix and
suffix&mdash;by its tensal, its pronominal, its substantive, its adjective,
and its adverbial terminations, for barrenness and rigidity in all
other parts of speech. Influenced by this reflection, I shall defer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>in the present inquiry, the remarks I intend offering on the verb,
until I have considered the substantive, and its more important
adjuncts.</p>

<p>Palpable objects, to which the idea of sense strongly attaches,
and the actions or condition, which determine the relation of one
object to another, are perhaps the first points to demand attention
in the invention of languages. And they have certainly imprinted
themselves very strongly, with all their materiality, and with all
their local, and exclusive, and personal peculiarities upon the
Indian. The noun and the verb not only thus constitute the
principal elements of speech, as in all languages; but they continue
to perform their first offices, with less direct aid from the
auxiliary parts of speech, than would appear to be reconcilable
with a clear expression of the circumstances of time and place,
number and person, quality and quantity, action and repose, and
the other accidents, on which their definite employment depends.
But to enable the substantives and attributives to perform these
complex offices, they are provided with inflections, and undergo
changes and modifications, by which words and phrases become
very concrete in their meaning, and are lengthened out to appear
formidable to the eye. Hence the polysyllabic, and the descriptive
character of the language, so composite in its aspect and in
its forms.</p>

<p>To utter succinctly, and in as few words as possible, the prominent
ideas resting upon the mind of the speaker, appear to have
been the paramount object with the inventors of the language.
Hence, concentration became a leading feature. And the pronoun,
the adjective, the adverb, and the preposition, however they may
be disjunctively employed in certain cases, are chiefly useful as
furnishing materials to the speaker, to be worked up into the complicated
texture of the verb and the substantive. Nothing, in
fact, can be more unlike, than the language, viewed in its original,
elementary state&mdash;in a vocabulary, for instance, of its primitive
words, so far as such a vocabulary can now be formed, and the
same language as heard under its oral, amalgamated form. Its
transpositions may be likened to a picture, in which the copal,
the carmine, and the white lead, are no longer recognized as distinct
substances, but each of which has contributed its share towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>the effect. It is the painter only who possesses the principle,
by which one element has been curtailed, another augmented,
and all, however seemingly discordant, made to coalesce.</p>

<p>Such a language may be expected to abound in derivatives and
compounds; to afford rules for giving verbs substantive, and substantives
verbal qualities; to concentrate the meaning of words
upon a few syllables, or upon a single letter, or alphabetical sign;
and to supply modes of contraction and augmentation, and, if I
may so say, <i>short cuts</i>, and <i>by-paths</i> to meanings, which are equally
novel and interesting. To arrive at its primitives, we must pursue
an intricate thread, where analogy is often the only guide.
We must divest words of those accumulated syllables, or particles,
which, like the molecules of material matter, are clustered
around the primitives. It is only after a process of this kind, that
the <i>principle of combination</i>&mdash;that secret wire, which moves the
whole machinery can be searched for, with a reasonable prospect
of success. The labor of analysis is one of the most interesting
and important, which the subject presents. And it is a labor
which it will be expedient to keep constantly in view, until we
have separately considered the several parts of speech, and the
grammatical laws by which the language is held together; and
thus established principles and provided materials wherewith we
may the more successfully labor.</p>

<p>1. In a general survey of the language as it is spoken, and as
it must be written, there is perhaps no feature which obtrudes itself
so constantly to view, as the principle which separates all
words, of whatever denomination, into animates and inanimates,
as they are applied to objects in the animal, vegetable, or mineral
kingdom. This principle has been grafted upon most words, and
carries its distinctions throughout the syntax. It is the gender of
the language; but a gender of so unbounded a scope, as to merge in
it the common distinctions of a masculine and feminine, and to give
a twofold character to the parts of speech. The concords which it
requires, and the double inflections it provides, will be mentioned
in their appropriate places. It will be sufficient here to observe,
that animate nouns require animate verbs for their nominatives,
animate adjectives to express their qualities, and animate demonstrative
pronouns to mark the distinctions of person. Thus, if we say,
"I see a man; I see a house," the termination of the verb must
be changed. What was in the first instance <i>wâb imâ</i>, is altered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
to <i>wâb indân</i>. <i>Wâb</i>, is here the infinitive, but the root of this
verb is still more remote. If the question occurs "Is it a good
man, or a good house," the adjective, which, in the inanimate form
is <i>onishish-í</i>, is, in the animate <i>onishish-i[n']</i>. If the question be put,
"Is it this man, or this house," the pronoun <i>this</i>, which is <i>mâ bum</i>,
in the animate, is changed to <i>mâ ndun</i>, in the inanimate.</p>

<p>Nouns animate embrace the tribes of quadrupeds, birds, fishes,
insects, reptiles, crustacæ, the sun, and moon, and stars, thunder,
and lightning, for these are personified; and whatever either possesses
animal life, or is endowed, by the peculiar opinions and
superstitions of the Indians, with it. In the vegetable kingdom,
their number is comparatively limited, being chiefly confined to
trees, and those only while they are referred to, as whole bodies,
and to the various species of fruits, and seeds, and esculents. It
is at the option of the speaker to employ nouns, either as animates
or inanimates: but it is a choice seldom resorted to, except in
conformity with stated exceptions. These conventional exceptions
are not numerous, and the more prominent of them, may be
recited. The cause of the exceptions it is not always easy to perceive.
It may, however, generally be traced to a particular respect
paid to certain inanimate bodies, either from their real or
fancied properties&mdash;the uses to which they are applied, or the
ceremonies to which they are dedicated. A stone, which is the
altar of sacrifice to their Manitoes; a bow, formerly so necessary
in the chase; a feather, the honored sign of martial prowess; a
kettle, so valuable in the household; a pipe, by which friendships
are sealed and treaties ratified; a drum, used in their sacred and
festive dances; a medal, the mask of authority; vermilion, the
appropriate paint of the warrior; wampum, by which messages
are conveyed, and covenants remembered. These are among the
objects, in themselves inanimates, which require the application
of animate verbs, pronouns, and adjectives, and are thereby transferred
to the animate class.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, however, that the names for animals, are
only employed as animates, while the objects are referred to as
whole and complete species. But the gender must be changed,
when it becomes necessary to speak of separate numbers. Man,
woman, father, mother, are separate nouns, so long as the individuals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>are meant; but hand, foot, head, eye, ear, tongue, are inanimates.
Buck, is an animate noun, while his entire carcass is
referred to, whether living or dead; but neck, back, heart, windpipe,
take the inanimate form. In like manner, eagle, swan, dove,
are distinguished as animates; but beak, wing, tail, are arranged
with inanimates. So oak, pine, ash, are animate; branch, leaf,
root, inanimates.</p>

<p>Reciprocal exceptions, however, exist to this rule&mdash;the reasons
for which, as in the former instance, may generally be sought,
either in peculiar opinions of the Indians, or in the peculiar
qualities or uses of the objects. Thus the talons of the eagle,
and the claws of the bear, and of other animals, which furnish
ornaments for the neck, are invariably spoken of, under the animate
form. The hoofs and horns of all quadrupeds, which are applied
to various economical and mystic purposes; the castorum of the
beaver, and the nails of man, are similarly situated. The vegetable
creation also furnishes some exceptions of this nature; such
are the names for the outer bark of all trees (except the birch),
and the branches, the roots, and the resin of the spruce, and its
congeners.</p>

<p>In a language, which considers all nature as separated into two
classes of bodies, characterized by the presence or absence of life;
neuter nouns will scarcely be looked for, although such may exist
without my knowledge. Neuters are found amongst the verbs
and the adjectives, but it is doubtful whether they render the
nouns to which they are applied neuters, in the sense we attach
to that term. The subject in all its bearings is interesting, and a
full and minute description of it would probably elicit new light
respecting some doubtful points in the language, and contribute
something towards a curious collateral topic&mdash;the history of Indian
opinions. I have stated the principle broadly, without filling
up the subject of exceptions as fully as it is in my power, and
without following its bearings upon points which will more properly
come under discussion at other stages of the inquiry. A
sufficient outline, it is believed, has been given, and having thus
met, at the threshold, a principle deeply laid at the foundation of
the language, and one which will be perpetually recurring, I
shall proceed to enumerate some other prominent features of the
substantive.</p>

<p>2. No language is perhaps so defective, as to be totally without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
number. But there are, probably, few which furnish so many
modes of indicating it, as the Odjibwa. There are as many modes
of forming the plural, as there are vowel sounds, yet there is no
distinction between a limited and unlimited plural; although there
is, in the pronoun, an <i>inclusive</i> and an <i>exclusive</i> plural. Whether
we say <i>man</i> or <i>men</i>, <i>two men</i> or <i>twenty men</i>, the singular <i>inin´i</i>, and
the plural <i>nin´iwug</i>, remains the same. But if we say <i>we</i>, or <i>us</i>,
or <i>our men</i> (who are present), or <i>we</i>, or <i>us</i>, or <i>our Indians</i> (in general),
the plural <i>we</i>, and <i>us</i>, and <i>our</i>&mdash;for they are rendered by the
same form&mdash;admit of a change to indicate whether the objective
person be <i>included</i> or <i>excluded</i>. This principle, of which full examples
will be given under the appropriate head, forms a single
and anomalous instance of the use of particular plurals. And it
carries its distinctions, by means of the pronouns, separable and
inseparable, into the verbs and substantives, creating the necessity
of double conjugations and double declensions, in the plural forms
of the first person. Thus, the term for "Our Father," which, in
the inclusive form is <i>Kósinân</i>, is, in the exclusive, <i>Nósinân</i>.</p>

<p>The particular plural, which is thus, by the transforming power
of the language, carried from the pronoun into the texture of the
verb and substantive, is not limited to any fixed number of persons
or objects, but arises from the operations of the verb. The
general plural is variously made. But the plurals making inflections
take upon themselves an additional power or sign, by which
substantives are distinguished into animate and inanimate. Without
this additional power, all nouns plural would end in the
vowels <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>. But to mark the gender, the letter <i>g</i> is added
to animates, and the letter <i>n</i> to inanimates, making the plurals
of the first class terminate in _âg_, <i>eeg</i>, <i>ig</i>, _ôg_, <i>ug</i>, and of the second
class in _ân_, <i>een</i>, <i>in</i>, _ôn_, <i>un</i>. Ten modes of forming the plural are
thus provided, five of which are animate, and five inanimate
plurals. A strong and clear line of distinction is thus drawn between
the two classes of words; so unerring, indeed, in its application,
that it is only necessary to inquire how the plural is formed,
to determine whether it belonged to one or the other class. The
distinctions which we have endeavored to convey will, perhaps,
be more clearly perceived, by adding examples of the use of each
of the plurals.</p>

<p>Where a noun terminates with a vowel in the singular, the
addition of the <i>g</i>, or <i>n</i>,shows at once, both the plural and the
gender. In other instances, as in <i>peenai</i>, a partridge&mdash;<i>seebi</i>, a river&mdash;it
requires a consonant to precede the plural vowel, in conformity
with a rule previously stated. Thus, <i>peenai</i>, is rendered
<i>peenai-wug</i>&mdash;and <i>seebi</i>, <i>seebi-wun</i>. Where the noun singular terminates
in the broad, instead of the long sound of <i>a</i>, as in <i>ogimâ</i>,
a chief, <i>ishpatinâ</i>, a hill, the plural is <i>ogim-ag</i>, <i>ishpatinân</i>. But
these are mere modifications of two of the above forms, and are

<p>Others may be found, and indeed, a few others are known.
But it is less an object, in this lecture, to pursue exceptions into
their minutest ramifications, than to sketch broad rules, applicable,
if not to every word, to at least a majority of words in the language.</p>

<p>There is, however, one exception from the general use of number,
so peculiar in itself, that not to point it out would be an
unpardonable remissness in giving the outlines of a language, in
which it is an object neither to extenuate faults nor to overrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
beauties. This exception consists in the want of number in the
<i>third person</i> of the declensions of animate nouns, and the conjugation
of animate verbs. Not that such words are destitute of
number, in their simple forms, or when used under circumstances
requiring no change of these simple forms&mdash;no prefixes and no
inflections. But it will be seen, at a glance, how very limited
such an application of words must be, in a transpositive language.</p>

<p>Thus <i>mang</i> and <i>kâg</i> (loon and porcupine) take the plural inflection
<i>wug</i>, becoming <i>mang wug</i> and <i>kâg wug</i> (loons and porcupines).
So, in their pronominal declension:&mdash;</p>

<table id="language3" summary="more plural2">

  <td class="tdl">My loon</td>
  <td class="tdl">Ni mang</td>

<p>But his loon, or loons (<i>o many oom un</i>), his porcupine or porcupines
(<i>o gâg oom un</i>), are without number. The rule applies
equally to the class of words in which the pronouns are inseparable.
Thus, my father and thy father, <i>nôs</i> and <i>kôs</i>, become my
fathers and thy fathers, by the numerical inflection <i>ug</i>, forming
<i>nôsug</i> and <i>kôsug</i>. But _ôsun_, his father or fathers, is vague, and
does not indicate whether there be one father or twenty fathers.
The inflection <i>un</i>, merely denotes the <i>object</i>. The rule also applies
equally to sentences in which the noun is governed by or governs
the verb. Whether we say, "I saw a bear," <i>ningi wâbumâ mukwah</i>,
or "a bear saw me," <i>mukwah ningi wâbumig</i>, the noun, itself,
undergoes no change, and its number is definite. But <i>ogi wâbumân
muk-wun</i>, "he saw bear," is indefinite, although both the verb
and the noun have changed their endings. And if the narrator
does not subsequently determine the number, the hearer is either
left in doubt, or must resolve it by a question. In fine, the whole
acts of the third person are thus rendered questionable. This
want of precision, which would seem to be fraught with so much
confusion, appears to be obviated in practice, by the employment
of adjectives, by numerical inflections in the relative words of
the sentence, by the use of the indefinite article, <i>paizhik</i>, or by
demonstrative pronouns. Thus, <i>paizhik mukwun ogi wâbumân</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
conveys with certainty the information "he saw <i>a</i> bear." But
in this sentence both the noun and the verb retain the objective
inflections, as in the former instances. These inflections are not
uniformly <i>un</i>, but sometimes <i>een</i>, as in <i>ogeen</i>, his mother, and
sometimes _ôn_, as in <i>odakeek-ôn</i>, his kettle, in all which instances,
however, the number is left indeterminate. It may hence be
observed, and it is a remark which we shall presently have occasion
to corroborate, that the plural inflection to inanimate nouns
(which have no objective form), forms the objective inflection to
animate nouns, which have no number in the third person.</p>

<p>3. This leads us to the consideration of the mode of forming
possessives, the existence of which, when it shall have been indicated
by full examples, will present to the mind of the inquirer,
one of those tautologies in grammatical forms, which, without
imparting additional precision, serve to clothe the language with
accumulated verbiage. The strong tendency to combination and
amalgamation, existing in the language, renders it difficult, in
fact, to discuss the principles of it in that elementary form which
could be wished. In the analysis of words and forms we are
constantly led from the central point of discussion. To recur,
however, from these collateral unravellings to the main thread of
inquiry, at as short and frequent intervals as possible, and thus
to preserve the chain of conclusions and proofs, is so important,
that, without keeping the object distinctly in view, I should despair
of conveying any clear impressions of those grammatical
features which impart to the language its peculiar character.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that the distinctions of number are
founded upon a modification of the five vowel sounds. Possessives
are likewise founded upon the basis of the vowel sounds.
There are five declensions of the noun to mark the possessive,
ending in the possessive in _âm_, <i>eem</i>, <i>im</i>, _ôm_, <i>um</i>, <i>oom</i>. Where the
nominative ends with a vowel, the possessive is made by adding
the letter <i>m</i>, as in <i>maimai</i>, a woodcock, <i>ni maimaim</i>, my woodcock,
&amp;c. Where the nominative ends in a consonant, as in <i>ais</i>,
a shell, the full possessive inflection is required, making <i>nin daisim</i>,
my shell. In the latter form, the consonant <i>d</i> is interposed
between the pronoun and noun, and sounded with the noun, in
conformity with a general rule. Where the nominative ends in
the broad in lieu of the long sound of <i>a</i>, as in <i>ogimâ</i>, a chief, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
possessive is _âm_. The sound of <i>i</i>, in the third declension, is that
of <i>i</i> in pin, and the sound of <i>u</i>, in the fifth declension, is that of
<i>u</i> in bull. The latter will be uniformly represented by <i>oo</i>.</p>

<p>The possessive declensions run throughout both the animate
and inanimate classes of nouns, with some exceptions in the latter,
as knife, bowl, paddle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Inanimate nouns are thus declined.</p>

<p>Animate substantives are declined precisely in the same manner
as inanimate, except in the third person, which takes to the possessive
inflections, <i>aim</i>, <i>eem</i>, <i>im</i>, _ôm_, <i>oom</i>, the objective particle <i>un</i>,
denoting the compound inflection of this person, both in the
singular and plural, <i>aimun</i>, <i>eemun</i>, <i>imun</i>, _ômun_, <i>oomun</i>, and the
variation of the first vowel sound, _âmun_. Thus, to furnish an
example of the second declension, <i>bizhiki</i>, a bison, changes its
forms to <i>nim</i>, <i>bizhik-im</i>, my bison&mdash;<i>ke bizhik-im</i>, thy bison, <i>O bizhik-imun</i>,
his bison, or bisons.</p>

<p>The cause of this double inflection in the third person, may be
left for future inquiry. But we may add further examples in aid
of it. We cannot simply say, "The chief has killed a bear," or,
to reverse the object upon which the energy of the verb is exerted,
"The bear has killed a chief." But, <i>ogimâ ogi nissân muk-wun</i>,
literally, "Chief he has has killed him bear," or, <i>mukwah ogi</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
<i>nissân ogimân</i>, "Bear he has killed him chief." Here the verb
and the noun are both objective in <i>un</i>, which is sounded _ân_, where
it comes after the broad sound of <i>a</i>, as in <i>nissân</i>, objective of the
verb to kill. If we confer the powers of the English possessive
(_'s_), upon the inflections <i>aim</i>, <i>eem</i>, <i>im</i>, _ôm_, <i>oom</i>, and _âm_, respectively,
and the meaning of <i>him</i>, and of course <i>he</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>hers</i>, <i>they</i>, <i>theirs</i>
(as there is no declension of the pronoun, and no number to the
third person), upon the objective particle <i>un</i>, we shall then translate
the above expression, <i>o bizhik-eemum</i>, his bison's hisn. If we
reject this meaning, as I think we should, the sentence would read,
"His bison," him, a mere tautology.</p>

<p>It is true, it may be remarked, that the noun possessed, has a
corresponding termination, or pronominal correspondence, with
the pronoun possessor, also a final termination indicative of its
being the <i>object</i> on which the verb exerts its influence&mdash;a mode of
expression, which, so far as relates to the possessive, would be
deemed superfluous, in modern languages; but may have some
analogy in the Latin accusatives <i>am</i>, <i>um</i>, <i>em</i>.</p>

<p>It is a constant and unremitting aim in the Indian languages
to distinguish the actor from the object, partly by prefixes, and
partly by inseparable suffixes. That the termination <i>un</i>, is one
of these inseparable particles, and that its office, while it confounds
the number, is to designate the object, appears probable from the
fact, that it retains its connection with the noun, whether the latter
follow or precede the verb, or whatever its position in the sentence
may be.</p>

<p>Thus we can, without any perplexity in the meaning say, <i>Waimittigôzhiwug
ogi sagiân Pontiac-un</i>, "Frenchmen, they did love
Pontiac him." Or to reverse it, <i>Pontiac-un Waimittigôzhiwug ogi
sagiân</i>, "Pontiac, he did Frenchmen he loved." The termination
<i>un</i>, in both instances, clearly determines the object beloved. So
in the following instance, <i>Sagunoshug ogi sagiân Tecumseh-un</i>,
"Englishmen, they did love Tecumseh," or <i>Tecumseh-un Sagunoshug
oji sagiân</i>, "Tecumseh, he did Englishmen he loved."</p>

<p>In tracing the operation of this rule, through the doublings of
the language, it is necessary to distinguish every modification of
sound, whether it is accompanied or not accompanied by a modification
of the sense. The particle <i>un</i>, which thus marks <i>the third
person and persons</i>, is sometimes pronounced <i>wun</i>, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
<i>yun</i>, as the harmony of the word to which it is suffixed may
require. But not the slightest change is thereby made in its
meaning.</p>

<div class="language">

<li>Ontwa loves his dog. L. O. he loves him, his dog, or dogs.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In these sentences, the letters <i>w</i> and <i>y</i> are introduced before
the inflection <i>un</i>, merely for euphony's sake, and to enable the
speaker to utter the final vowel of the substantive, and the inflective
vowel, without placing both under the accent. It is to
be remarked in these examples, that the verb has a corresponding
inflection with the noun, indicated by the final consonant <i>n</i>, as in
<i>sagiâ-n</i>, objective of the verb <i>to love</i>. This is merely a modification
of <i>un</i>, where it is requisite to employ it after broad <i>a</i> (<i>aw</i>),
and it is applicable to nouns as well as verbs whenever they end
in that sound. Thus, in the phrase, "He saw a chief," <i>O wâbumâ-n
O gimâ-n</i>, both noun and verb terminate in <i>n</i>. It is immaterial
to the sense, which precedes. And this leads to the
conclusion, which we are in some measure compelled to state in
anticipation of our remarks on the verb: That verbs must not
only agree with their nominatives in number, person, and <i>gender</i>
(we use the latter term for want of a more appropriate one), but
also with their objectives. Hence, the objective sign <i>n</i> in the
above examples. Sometimes this sign is removed from the ending
of the verb, to make room for the plural of the nominative
person, and is subjoined to the latter. Thus,</p>

<div class="language">
<ul>
<li>O sagiâ(wâ)n.</li>
<li>They love them (him or them).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In this phrase, the interposed syllable (<i>wâ</i>) is, apparently, the
plural&mdash;it is a reflective plural&mdash;of <i>he</i>&mdash;the latter being indicated,
as usual, by the sign <i>O</i>. It has been observed, above, that the
deficiency in number, in the third person, is sometimes supplied
"by numerical inflections in the relative words of the sentence,"
and this interposed particle (<i>wâ</i>) affords an instance in point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
The number of the nominative pronoun appears to be thus rendered
precise, but the objective is still indefinite.</p>

<p>When two nouns are used without a verb in the sentence, or
when two nouns compose the whole matter uttered, being in the
third person, both have the full objective inflection. Thus,</p>

<div class="language">
<ul>
<li>Os-(un). Odi-(yun).</li>
<li>His father's dog. L. His father&mdash;his dog or dogs.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The word <i>Dy</i>, which supplies this declension, is derived from
<i>Indyiâm</i> mine. <i>pron. an.</i>&mdash;a derivative form of the word, which is,
however, exclusively restricted, in its meaning, to the dog. If
the expression <i>Nin Dy</i> or <i>N' Dy</i>, is sometimes applied to the
horse, it is because it is thereby intended to call him, my dog,
from his being in a state of servitude similar to that of the dog.
It must be borne in mind, as connected with this subject, that
the dog, in high northern latitudes, and even as far south as 42
degrees, is both a beast of draught and of burden. He is compelled
during the winter season to draw the <i>odâban</i>, or Indian
sleigh; and sometimes to support the burden upon his back, by
means of a kind of drag constructed of slender poles.</p>

<p>A review of the facts which have been brought together
respecting the substantive, will show that the separable or inseparable
pronouns under the form of prefixes, are throughout required.
It will also indicate, that the inflections of the first and
second persons which occupy the place of possessives, and those
of the third person, resembling objectives, pertain to words, which
are either primitives, or denote but a single object, as <i>moose</i>, <i>fire</i>.
There is, however, another class of substantives, or substantive
expressions, and an extensive class&mdash;for it embraces a great portion
of the compound descriptive terms&mdash;in the use of which no
pronominal prefixes are required. The distinctions of person are,
exclusively, supplied by pronominal suffixes. Of this character
are the words descriptive of country, place of dwelling, field of
battle, place of employment, &amp;c. The following example will
furnish the inflections applicable to this entire class of words:&mdash;</p>

<p>By these examples, it is perceived that the final <i>d</i> in <i>aindâd</i> is
not essential to its primitive meaning; and that the place of the
pronoun is, in respect to this word, invariably a suffix. <i>Aindâd</i>
means, truly, not home, but his home. The plural is formed by
the inflection <i>in</i>, except in the third person, where the sound of <i>d</i>
sinks in <i>j</i>.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent">Further remarks on the substantive&mdash;Local, diminutive, derogative, and tensal inflections&mdash;Mode
in which the latter are employed to denote the disease of individuals,
and to indicate the past and future seasons&mdash;Restricted or sexual terms&mdash;Conversion
of the substantive into a verb, and the reciprocal character of the
verb by which it is converted into a substantive&mdash;Derivative and compound substantives&mdash;Summary
of the properties of this part of speech.</p>

<p>In the view which has been taken of the substantive in the
preceding Inquiry, it has been deemed proper to exclude several
topics, which, from their peculiarities, it was believed could be
more satisfactorily discussed in a separate form. Of this character
are those modifications of the substantive by which locality,
diminution, a defective quality, and the past tense are expressed;
by which various adjective and adverbial significations are given;
and, finally, the substantives themselves converted into verbs.
Such are also the mode of indicating the masculine and feminine
(both merged, as we have shown, in the animate class), and those
words which are of a strictly <i>sexual</i> character, or are restricted in
their <i>use</i> either to males or females. Not less interesting is the
manner of forming derivatives, and of conferring upon the derivatives
so formed a <i>personality</i>, distinguished as either animate
or inanimate, at the option of the speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
Much of the flexibility of the substantive is derived from these
properties, and they undoubtedly add much to the figurative
character of the language. Some of them have been thought
analogous to case, particularly that inflection of the noun which
indicates the locality of the object. But if so, then there would
be equally strong reasons for establishing an <i>adjective</i>, and an
<i>adverbial</i>, as well as a <i>local</i> case, and a plurality of forms in each.
But it is believed that no such necessity exists. There is no
regular declension of these forms, and they are all used under
limitations and restrictions incompatible with the true principles
of case.</p>

<p>It is under this view of the subject, that the discussion of these
forms has been transferred, together with the other accidents of
the substantive just adverted to, and reserved as the subject-matter
of a separate inquiry. And in now proceeding to express
the conclusions at which we have arrived touching these points,
it will be an object so to compress and arrange the materials
before us, as to present within a small compass the leading facts
and examples upon which each separate position depends.</p>

<p>1. That quality of the noun which, in the shape of an inflection,
denotes the relative situation of the object, by the contiguous
position of some accessory object, is expressed in the English language
by the prepositions <i>in</i>, <i>into</i>, <i>at</i>, or <i>on</i>. In the Indian, they
are denoted by an inflection. Thus, the phrase "In the box," is
rendered in the Indian by one word, <i>mukukoong</i>. Of this word,
<i>mukuk</i>, simply, is box. The termination, <i>oong</i>, denoting the
locality, not of the box, but of the object sought after. The expression
appears to be precise, although there is no definite article
in the language.</p>

<p>The substantive takes this form, most commonly, after a question
has been put, as <i>Anindi ni môkoman-ais?</i> "Where is my penknife?"
<i>Mukukoong</i> (in the box), <i>addôpowin-ing</i> (on the table),
are definite replies to this question. But the form is not restricted
to this relation. <i>Chimân-ing n'guh pôz</i>, "I shall embark in the
canoe;" <i>wakyigum n'ghu izhâ</i>, "I shall go into the house," are
perfectly correct, though somewhat formal expressions, when the
canoe or the house are present to the speaker's view.</p>

<p>The meaning of these inflections has been restricted to <i>in</i>, <i>into</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
<i>at</i>, and <i>on</i>, but they are the more appropriate forms of expressing
the first three senses, there being other modes besides these of
expressing the preposition <i>on</i>. These modes consist in the use
of prepositions, and will be explained under that head. The
choice of the one or the other is, however, with the speaker.
Generally, the inflection is employed when there is some circumstance
or condition of the noun either concealed or not fully apparent.
Thus, <i>Muzzinyigun-ing</i>, is the appropriate term for "In
the book," and <i>may</i> also be used to signify "On the book." But
if it is meant only to signify <i>on</i> the book, something visible being
referred to, the preposition <i>ogidj</i> would be used, that word indicating
with certainty <i>on</i>, and never <i>in</i>. <i>Wakyigun-ing</i> indicates
with clearness "In the house;" but if it is necessary to say "On
the house," and it be meant at the same time to exclude any reference
to the interior, the expression would be changed to <i>ogidj
wakyigun</i>.</p>

<p>It will be proper further to remark in this place, in the way
of limitation, that there is also a separate preposition signifying
<i>in</i>. It is <i>pinj</i>. But the use of this word does not, in all cases,
supersede the necessity of inflecting the noun. Thus, the expression
<i>pindigain</i>, is literally walk in, or enter. But if it is intended
to say, "Walk in the house," the local, and not the simple form
of house must be used; and the expression is, <i>Pindigain waky'igun-ing</i>,
"Enter in the house," the verbal form which this preposition
<i>pinj</i> puts on, having no allusion to the act of <i>walking</i>, but merely
implying position.</p>

<p>The local inflection, which, in the above examples, is <i>ing</i> and
<i>oong</i>, is further changed to <i>aing</i> and <i>eeng</i>, as the ear may direct&mdash;changes
which are governed chiefly by the terminal vowel of the
noun. Examples will best supply the rule, as well as the exceptions
to it.</p>

<p>An attentive inspection of these examples will show that the
local form pertains either to such nouns of the animate class as
are in their nature inanimate, or at most possessed of vegetable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>life. And here another conclusion presses upon us; that where
these local terminations, in all their variety, are added to the
names of animated beings, when such names are the nominatives
of adjectives or adjective-nouns, these words are converted into
terms of qualification, indicating <i>like</i>, <i>resembling</i>, <i>equal</i>. Thus, if
we wish to say to a boy, "He is like a man," the expression is,
<i>Inin-ing izzhinâgozzi</i>; or, if to a man, "He is like a bear," <i>Mukk-oong
izzhinâgozzi</i>; or, to a bear, "He is like a horse, <i>Pabaizhikogâzh-ing
izzhinâgozzi</i>. In all these expressions, the word <i>izzhi</i> is
combined with the pronominal inflection _â_ (or <i>nâ</i>) and the animate
termination <i>gozzi</i>. And the inflection of the nominative is
merely an adjective corresponding with <i>izzhi</i>&mdash;a term indicative
of the general qualities of persons or animated beings. Where a
comparison is instituted, or a resemblance pointed out, between
inanimate instead of animate objects, the inflection <i>gozzi</i> is changed
to <i>gwud</i>, rendering the expression, which was, in the animate
form, <i>izzhinâ</i>gozzi, in the inanimate form <i>izzhinâ</i>zgwud.</p>

<p>There is another variation of the local form of the noun, in
addition to those above instanced, indicative of locality in a more
general sense. It is formed by <i>ong</i> or <i>nong</i>&mdash;frequent terminations
in geographical names. Thus, from <i>Ojibwai</i>, Chippewa, is
formed <i>Ojibwai</i>nong, "Place of the Chippewas." From <i>Wamattigozhiwug</i>,
Frenchmen, is formed <i>Wamittigozhi</i>nong, "Place of
Frenchmen." From <i>Ishpatinâ</i>, Hill, <i>Ishpatinong</i>, "Place of the
hill," &amp;c. The termination <i>ing</i>, is also sometimes employed in
this more general sense, as in the following names of places:&mdash;</p>

<div class="language">
<ul>
<li>Monomonikâ<i>ning</i>. In the place of wild rice.</li>
<li>Moninggwunikâ<i>ning</i>. In the place of sparrows.</li>
<li>Ongwashagoosh<i>ing</i>. In the place of the fallen tree, &amp;c.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>2. The diminutive forms of the noun are indicated by <i>ais</i>, <i>eas</i>,
_ôs_, and <i>aus</i>, as the final vowel of the word may require. Thus,
<i>Ojibwai</i>, a Chippewa, becomes <i>Ojibw-ais</i>, a little Chippewa: <i>Inin´i</i>,
a man, <i>inin-ees</i>, a little man: <i>Amik</i>, a beaver, <i>amik-ôs</i>, a young
beaver: <i>Ogimâ</i>, a chief, <i>ogim-âs</i>, a little chief, or a chief of little
authority. Further examples may be added.</p>

<p>In the last four examples, the letter <i>n</i>, of the diminutive, retains
its full sound.</p>

<p>The use of diminutives has a tendency to give conciseness to
the language. As far as they can be employed they supersede
the use of adjectives, or prevent the repetition of them. And
they enable the speaker to give a turn to the expression, which
is often very successfully employed in producing ridicule or contempt.
When applied to the tribes of animals, or to inorganic
objects, their meaning, however, is, very nearly, limited to an
inferiority in size or age. Thus, in the above examples, <i>pizhik-ees</i>,
signifies a calf; <i>omim-ees</i>, a young pigeon; and <i>ossin-ees</i>, a pebble,
&amp;c. But <i>inin-ees</i>, and <i>ogim-âs</i>, are connected with the idea of
mental or conventional as well as bodily inferiority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<div class="language">
<ul>
<li>1. I saw a little chief, standing upon a small island, with an inferior medal about
his neck.</li>
<li><span class="i1">Ogimâs n'gi wâbumâ nibowid minnisainsing onâbikowân shoniâsun.</span></li>
<li>2. Yamoyden threw at a young pigeon.</li>
<li><span class="i1">Ogi pukkitaiwun omimeesun Yamoyden.</span></li>
<li>3. A buffalo calf stood in a small stream.</li>

<li>4. The little man fired at a young moose.</li>
<li><span class="i1">Ininees ogi pâshkizwân môzôsun.</span></li>
<li>5. Several diminutive-looking bass were lying in a small bowl, upon a small
table.</li>
<li><span class="i1">Addôpowinaising attai onâgâns abbiwâd ogâsug.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Some of these sentences afford instances of the use, at the same
time, of both the local and diminutive inflections. Thus, the
word <i>minnisainsing</i>, signifies literally, "in the little island;" <i>seebees-ing</i>, "in the little stream;" <i>addôpowinais ing</i>, "on the small table."</p>

<p>3. The preceding forms are not the only ones by which adjective
qualities are conferred upon the substantive. The syllable
<i>ish</i>, when added to a noun, indicates a bad or dreaded quality, or
conveys the idea of imperfection or decay. The sound of this
inflection is sometimes changed to <i>eesh</i>, <i>oosh</i>, or <i>aush</i>. Thus, <i>Chimân</i>,
a canoe, becomes <i>Chimânish</i>, a bad canoe; <i>Ekwai</i>, a woman,
<i>Ekwaiwish</i>, a bad woman; <i>nibi</i>, water, becomes <i>nibeesh</i>, turbid or
strong water; <i>mittig</i>, a tree, becomes <i>mittigoosh</i>, a decayed tree;
<i>akkik</i>, a kettle, <i>akkikoosh</i>, a worn-out kettle. By a further change,
<i>wibid</i>, a tooth, becomes <i>wibidâsh</i>, a decayed or aching tooth, &amp;c.
Throughout these changes the final sound of <i>sh</i> is retained, so
that this sound alone, at the end of a word, is indicative of a
faulty quality.</p>

<p>In a language in which the expressions <i>bad-dog</i> and <i>faint-heart</i>
are the superlative terms of reproach, and in which there are few
words to indicate the modifications between positively good and
positively bad, it must appear evident that adjective inflections
of this kind must be convenient, and sometimes necessary modes
of expression. They furnish a means of conveying censure and
dislike, which, though often mild, is sometimes severe. Thus, if
one person has had occasion to refuse the offered hand of another&mdash;for
it must be borne in mind that the Indians are a hand-shaking
people as well as the Europeans&mdash;the implacable party has it
at his option, in referring to the circumstance, to use the adjective
form of hand, not <i>onindj</i>, but <i>oninjeesh</i>, which would be deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
contemptuous in a high degree. So, also, instead of <i>odâwai winini</i>,
a trader, or man who sells, the word may be changed to <i>odâwai
winini</i>wish, implying a bad or dishonest trader. It is seldom that
a more pointed or positive mode of expressing personal disapprobation
or dislike is required; for, generally speaking, more is
implied by these modes than is actually expressed.</p>

<p>The following examples are drawn from the inorganic as well
as organic creation, embracing the two classes of nouns, that the
operation of these forms may be fully perceived.</p>

<p>These forms cannot be said, strictly, to be without analogy in
the English, in which the limited number of words terminating
in <i>ish</i>, as saltish, blackish, furnish a correspondence in sound with
the first adjective form.</p>

<p>It may subserve the purposes of generalization to add, as the

<p>4. More attention has, perhaps, been bestowed upon these
points than their importance demanded; but, in giving anything
like a comprehensive sketch of the substantive, they could not be
omitted; and, if mentioned at all, it became necessary to pursue
them through their various changes and limitations. Another
reason has presented itself. In treating of an unwritten language,
of which others are to judge chiefly from examples, it appeared
desirable that the positions advanced should be accompanied by
the data upon which they respectively rest&mdash;at least, by so much
of the data employed as to enable philologists to appreciate the
justice or detect the fallacy of our conclusions. To the few who
take any interest in the subject at all, minuteness will not seem
tedious, and the examples will be regarded with deep interest.</p>

<p>As much of our time as we have already devoted to these lesser
points of inquiry, it will be necessary, at this place, to point out
other inflections and modifications of the substantive, to clear it
from obscurities, that we may go into the discussion of the other
parts of speech unincumbered.</p>

<p>Of these remaining forms, none is more interesting than that
which enables the speaker, by a simple inflection, to denote that
the individual named has ceased to exist. This delicate mode of
conveying melancholy intelligence, or alluding to the dead, is
effected by placing the object in the past tense.</p>

<p class="language center">Aiekid-ôpun aieko Garrangula-bun.<br />
So the deceased Garrangula spoke.</p>

<p>The syllable <i>bun</i>, in this sentence, added to the noun, and _ôpun_
added to the verb, place both in the past tense. And, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
the death of the Indian orator is not mentioned, that fact would be
invariably inferred.</p>

<p>Names which do not terminate in a vowel sound, require a
vowel prefixed to the tensal inflection, rendering it _ôbun_ or <i>ebun</i>.
Inanimate as well as animate nouns take these inflections.</p>

<p>5. <i>Sexual Nouns.&mdash;</i>The mode of indicating the masculine and
feminine having been omitted in the preceding Inquiry, as not
being essential to any concordance with the verb or adjective, is,
nevertheless, connected with a striking peculiarity of the language&mdash;the
exclusive use of certain words by one or the other
sex. After having appeared to the founders of the language a
distinction not necessary to be engrafted in the syntax, there are
yet a limited number of words to which the idea of sex so strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
attaches, that it would be deemed the height of impropriety in a
female to use the masculine, and in a male to use the feminine expressions.</p>

<p>Of this nature are the words <i>Neeji</i> and <i>Nindongwai</i>, both signifying
my friend, but the former is appropriated to males and the
latter to females. A Chippewa cannot, therefore, say to a female,
my friend; nor a Chippewa woman to a male, my friend. Such
an interchange of the terms would imply arrogance or indelicacy.
Nearly the whole of their interjections&mdash;and they are numerous&mdash;are
also thus exclusively appropriated; and no greater breach
of propriety in speech could be committed, than a woman's uttering
the masculine exclamation of surprise, <i>Tyâ!</i> or a man's descending
to the corresponding female interjection, <i>N'yâ!</i></p>

<p>The word <i>Neenimoshai</i>, my cousin, on the contrary, can only
be applied, like husband and wife, by a male to a female, or a
female to a male. If a male wishes to express this relation of a
male, the term is <i>Neetowis</i>; and the corresponding female term
<i>Neendongwooshai</i>.</p>

<p>The terms for uncle and aunt are also of a twofold character,
though not restricted like the preceding in their use. <i>Neemishomai</i>,
is my uncle by the father's side; <i>Neezhishai</i>, my uncle by the mother's
side. <i>Neezigwoos</i>, is my paternal aunt; <i>Neewishai</i>, my maternal
aunt.</p>

<p>There are also exclusive words to designate elder brother and
younger brother; but, what would not be expected after the fore going
examples, they are indiscriminately applied to younger
brothers and sisters. <i>Neesgai</i>, is my elder brother, and <i>neemissai</i>,
my elder sister. <i>Neeshemai</i>, my younger brother or younger sister,
and may be applied to any brother or sister except the eldest.</p>

<p>The number of words to which the idea of sex is attached, in
the usual acceptation, is limited. The following may be enumerated.</p>

<p>6. <i>Reciprocal Changes of the Noun.</i>&mdash;The pronominal particles
with which verbs as well as substantives are generally encumbered,
and the habit of using them in particular and restricted
senses, leave but little occasion for the employment of either the
present or past infinitive. Most verbs are transitives. A Chippewa
does not say I love, without indicating, by an inflection of
the verb, the object beloved: and thus the expression is constantly,
I love him, or her, &amp;c. Neither does the infinitive appear
to be generally the ultimate form of the verb.</p>

<p>In changing their nouns into verbs, it will not, therefore, be
expected that the change should uniformly result in the infinitive,
for which there is so little use, but in such of the personal forms
of the various moods as circumstances may require. Most commonly,
the third person singular of the indicative, and the second
person singular of the imperative, are the simplest aspects under
which the verb appears; and hence these forms have been sometimes
mistaken for, and reported as the present infinitive. There
are some instances in which the infinitive is employed. Thus,
although an Indian cannot say I love, thou lovest, &amp;c., without
employing the objective forms of the verb to love, yet he can say
I laugh, I cry, &amp;c.; expressions in which, the action being confined
to the speaker himself, there is no transition demanded.
And in all similar instances the present infinitive, with the proper
pronoun prefixed, is employed.</p>

<p>There are several modes of transforming a substantive into a
verb. The following examples will supply the rules, so far as
known, which govern these changes:&mdash;</p>

In order to place the substantives thus formed in the third person,

<p>7. <i>Compound Substantives.</i>&mdash;The preceding examples have been
given promiscuously from the various classes of words, primitive
and derivative, simple and compound. Some of these words express
but a single idea, as, _ôs_, father&mdash;<i>gah</i>, mother&mdash;<i>môz</i>, a moose&mdash;<i>kâg</i>,
a porcupine&mdash;<i>mang</i>, a loon&mdash;and appear to be incapable of
further division. All such words may be considered as primitives,
although some of them may be contractions of dissyllabic words.
There are also a number of dissyllables, and <i>possibly</i> some trisyllables,
which, in the present state of our analytical knowledge
of the language, may be deemed both simple and primitive. Such
are <i>neebi</i>, water; <i>ossin</i>, a stone; <i>geezis</i>, the sun; <i>nodin</i>, wind. But
it may be premised, as a principle which our investigations have
rendered probable, that all polysyllabic words, all words of three
syllables, <i>so far as examined</i>, and most words of two syllables, are
compounds.</p>

<p>The application of a syntax, formed with a view to facilitate
the rapid conveyance of ideas by consolidation, may, it is presumable,
have early led to the coalescence of words, by which all
the relations of object and action, time and person, were expressed.
And in a language which is only spoken, and not written, the
primitives would soon become obscured and lost in the multiform
appendages of time and person, and the recondite connection of
actor and object. And this process of amalgamation would be a
progressive one. The terms that sufficed in the condition of the
simplest state of nature, or in a given latitude, would vary with
their varying habits, institutions, and migrations. The introduction
of new objects and new ideas would require the invention of
new words, or what is much more probable, existing terms would
be modified or compounded to suit the occasion. No one who
has paid much attention to the subject, can have escaped noticing
a confirmation of this opinion, in the extreme readiness of our
western Indians to bestow, on the instant, names, and appropriate
names&mdash;to any new object presented to them. A readiness not
attributable to their having at command a stock of generic polysyllables&mdash;for
these it would be very awkward to wield&mdash;but, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
appears more probable, to the powers of the syntax, which permits
the resolution of new compounds from existing roots, and often
concentrates, as remarked in another place, the entire sense of the
parent words, upon a single syllable, and sometimes upon a single
letter.</p>

<p>Thus it is evident that the Chippewas possessed names for a
living tree, <i>mittig</i>, and a string, <i>aiâb</i>, before they named the bow
<i>mittigwâb</i>&mdash;the latter being compounded under one of the simplest
rules from the two former. It is further manifest that they had
named earth <i>akki</i>, and (any solid, stony, or metallic mass) _âbik_,
before they bestowed an appellation upon the kettle, <i>akkeek</i>, or
<i>akkik</i>, the latter being derivatives from the former. In process
of time these compounds became the bases of other compounds,
and thus the language became loaded with double, and triple, and
quadruple compounds, concrete in their meaning and formal in
their utterance.</p>

<p>When the introduction of metals took place, it became necessary
to distinguish the clay from the iron pot, and the iron from
the copper kettle. The original compound, <i>akkeek</i>, retained its
first meaning, admitting the adjective noun <i>piwâbik</i> (itself a compound)
iron, when applied to a vessel of that kind, <i>piwâbik akkeek</i>,
iron kettle. But a new combination took place to designate the
copper kettle, <i>mishwâkeek</i>, red metal kettle; and another expression
to denote the brass kettle, <i>ozawâbik akkeek</i>, yellow metal kettle.
The former is made up from <i>miskôwâbik</i>, copper (literally <i>red-metal</i>&mdash;from
<i>miskwâ</i>, red, and _âbik_, the generic above mentioned),
and <i>akkeek</i>, kettle. <i>Ozawâbik</i>, brass, is from <i>ozawâ</i>, yellow, and
the generic <i>âbik</i>&mdash;the term <i>akkeek</i> being added in its separate
form. It may, however, be used in its connected form of <i>wukkeek</i>,
making the compound expression <i>ozawâbik wukkeek</i>.</p>

<p>In naming the horse <i>paibâizhikôgazhi, i. e.</i> the animal with solid
hoofs, they have seized upon the feature which most strikingly
distinguished the horse from the cleft-footed animals, which were
the only species known to them at the period of the discovery.
And the word itself affords an example, at once, both of their
powers of concentration, and brief, yet accurate description, which
it may be worth while to analyze. <i>Paizhik</i> is one, and is also
used as the indefinite article&mdash;the only article the language possesses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>This word is further used in an adjective sense, figura-tively
indicating, united, solid, undivided. And it acquires a
plural signification by doubling, or repeating the first syllable, with
a slight variation of the second. Thus, <i>Pai-baizhik</i> denotes not
<i>one</i>, or <i>an</i>, but several; and when thus used in the context, renders
the noun governed plural. <i>Oskuzh</i> is the nail, claw, or horny
part of the foot of beasts, and supplies the first substantive member
of the compound <i>gauzh</i>. The final vowel is from <i>ahwaisi</i>, a
beast; and the marked <i>o</i>, an inseparable connective, the office of
which is to make the two members coalesce, and harmonize. The
expression thus formed becomes a substantive, specific in its application.
It may be rendered plural like the primitive nouns,
may be converted into a verb, has its diminutive, derogative, and
local form, and, in short, is subject to all the modifications of other
substantives.</p>

<p>Most of the modern nouns are of this complex character. And
they appear to have been invented to designate objects, many of
which were necessarily unknown to the Indians in the primitive
ages of their existence. Others, like their names for a copper-kettle
and a horse, above mentioned, can date their origin further
back than the period of the discovery. Of this number of nascent
words, are most of their names for those distilled or artificial
liquors, for which they are indebted to Europeans. Their name
for water, <i>neebi</i>, for the fat of animals, <i>weenin</i>, for oil or grease,
<i>pimmidai</i>, for broth, <i>nâbôb</i>, and for blood, <i>miskwi</i>, belong to a
very remote era, although all but the first appear to be compounds.
Their names for the tinctures or extracts derived from
the forest, and used as dyes, or medicines, or merely as agreeable
drinks, are mostly founded upon the basis of the word _âbo_, a
liquid, although this word is never used alone. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>An interesting class of substantives is derived from the third

the vowel sound of the first syllable, and adding the letter d to

<p>This class of words is rendered plural in <i>ig</i>&mdash;a termination,
which, after <i>d</i> final in the singular, has a soft pronunciation, as
if written <i>jig</i>. Thus, <i>Nâmid</i>, a dancer, <i>nâmidjig</i>, dancers.</p>

<p>The derogative form is given to these generic substantives by
introducing <i>ish</i>, or simply <i>sh</i>, in place of the <i>d</i>, and changing the
latter to <i>kid</i>, making the terminations in <i>ai</i>, <i>aishkid</i>, in _â_, _âshkid_,
in <i>e</i>, <i>eeshkid</i>, in <i>i</i>, <i>ishkid</i>, and in <i>oo</i>, <i>ooshkid</i>. Thus, <i>naindowainjeegaid</i>,
a hunter, is changed to <i>naindowainjeegaishkid</i>, a bad or unprofitable
hunter. <i>Naibâd</i>, a sleeper, is changed to <i>naibâshkid</i>, a
sluggard. <i>Jossakeed</i>, a juggler, to <i>jossakeeshkid</i>, a vicious juggler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
<i>Wâsinnid</i>, an eater, to <i>wâssinishkid</i>, a gormandizer. <i>Kâgidood</i>, a
speaker, <i>kâgidooshkid</i>, a babbler. And in these cases the plural is
added to the last educed form, making <i>kâgidooshkidjig</i>, babblers,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The word <i>nittâ</i>, on the contrary, prefixed to those expressions,
renders them complimentary. For instance, <i>nittâ naigumood</i>, is a
fine singer, <i>nittâ kâgidood</i>, a ready speaker, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Flexible as the substantive has been shown to be, there are
other forms of combination that have not been adverted to&mdash;forms,
by which it is made to coalesce with the verb, the adjective,
and the preposition, producing a numerous class of compound
expressions. But it is deemed most proper to defer the discussion
of these forms to their several appropriate heads.</p>

<p>Enough has been exhibited to demonstrate its prominent grammatical
rules. It is not only apparent that the substantive possesses
number and gender, but it also undergoes peculiar modifications
to express locality and diminution, to denote adjective
qualities and to indicate tense. It exhibits some curious traits
connected with the mode of denoting the masculine and feminine.
It is modified to express person and to distinguish living from
inanimate masses. It is rendered possessive by a peculiar inflection,
and provides particles, under the shape either of prefixes or
suffixes, separable or inseparable, by which the actor is distinguished
from the object&mdash;and all this, without changing its
proper substantive character, without putting on the aspect of a
pseudo adjective, or a pseudo verb. Its changes to produce compounds
are, however, its most interesting, its most characteristic
trait. Syllable is heaped upon syllable, word upon word, and
derivative upon derivative, until its vocabulary is crowded with
long and pompous phrases, most formidable to the eye.</p>

<p>So completely transpositive do the words appear, that like chessmen
on a board, their elementary syllables can be changed at the
will of the player, to form new combinations to meet new contingencies,
so long as they are changed in accordance with certain
general principles and conventional rules; in the application of
which, however, much depends upon the will or the skill of the
player. What is most surprising, all these changes and combinations,
all these qualifications of the object, and distinctions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>person, the time, and the place, do not supersede the use of adjectives,
and pronouns, and verbs, and other parts of speech
woven into the texture of the noun, in their elementary and conjunctive
forms.</p>

<h4>III.<br />
<i>Principles Governing the Use of the Odjibwa Noun-Adjective.</i></h4>

<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Inquiry</span> 3.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent">Observations on the adjective&mdash;Its distinction into two classes denoted by the presence
or absence of vitality&mdash;Examples of the animates and inanimates&mdash;Mode of
their conversion into substantives&mdash;How pronouns are applied to these derivatives,
and the manner of forming compound terms from adjective bases to describe the
various natural phenomena&mdash;The application of these principles in common conversation,
and in the description of natural and artificial objects&mdash;Adjectives
always preserve the distinction of number&mdash;Numerals&mdash;Arithmetical capacity of
the language&mdash;The unit exists in duplicate.</p>

<p>1. It has been remarked that the distinction of words into
animates and inanimates, is a principle intimately interwoven
throughout the structure of the language. It is, in fact, so deeply
imprinted upon its grammatical forms, and is so perpetually recurring,
that it may be looked upon, not only as forming a striking
peculiarity of the language, but as constituting the fundamental
principle of its structure, from which all other rules have derived
their limits, and to which they have been made to conform. No
class of words appears to have escaped its impress. Whatever
concords other laws impose, they all agree, and are made subservient
in the establishment of this.</p>

<p>It might appear to be a useless distinction in the adjective,
when the substantive is thus marked; but it will be recollected
that it is in the plural of the substantive only that the distinction
is marked; and we shall, presently have occasion to show that
redundancy of forms is, to considerable extent, obviated in
practice.</p>

<p>For the origin of the principle itself, we need look only to
nature, which endows animate bodies with animate properties
and qualities, and <i>vice versâ</i>. But it is due to the tribes who speak
this language, to have invented one set of adjective symbols to
express the ideas peculiarly appropriate to the former, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
set applicable exclusively to the latter; and to have given the
words good and bad, black and white, great and small, handsome
and ugly, such modifications as are practically competent to indicate
the general nature of the objects referred to, whether provided
with, or destitute of, the vital principle. And not only so,
but, by the figurative use of these forms, to exalt inanimate
masses into the class of living beings, or to strip the latter of its
properties of life&mdash;a principle of much importance to their public
speakers.</p>

<p>This distinction is shown in the following examples, in which
it will be observed that the inflection <i>izzi</i> generally denotes the
personal, and <i>au</i>, <i>un</i>, or <i>wud</i>, the impersonal forms.</p>

<p>It is not, however, in all cases, by mere modifications of the
adjective that these distinctions are expressed. Words totally
different in sound, and evidently derived from radically different
roots, are, in some few instances, employed; as in the following
examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>It may be remarked of these forms, that, although the impersonal
will, in some instances, take the personal inflections, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
rule is not reciprocated, and <i>minno</i>, and <i>mindiddo</i>, and <i>gitizzi</i>, and
all words similarly situated, remain unchangeably animates. The
word <i>pungee</i> is limited to the expression of quantity, and its correspondent,
<i>uggaushi</i>, to size or quality. <i>Kishedä</i> (hot) is restricted
to the heat of a fire; <i>keezhautä</i>, to the heat of the sun. There is
still a third term to indicate the natural heat of the body; <i>kizzizoo</i>.
<i>Mitshau</i> (large) is generally applied to countries, lakes, rivers, &amp;c.;
<i>mindiddo</i>, to the body; and <i>gitshee</i>, indiscriminately. <i>Onishishin</i>,
and its correspondent, <i>onishishshä</i>, signify handsome or fair, as
well as good. <i>Kwonaudy</i>, a. a., and <i>kwonaudyewun</i>, a. i., mean,
strictly, handsome, and imply nothing further. <i>Minno</i> is the appropriate
personal form for good. <i>Mudjee</i> and <i>monaudud</i> may
reciprocally change genders, the first by the addition of <i>iee</i>, and
the second by altering <i>ud</i> to <i>izzi</i>.</p>

<p>Distinctions of this kind are of considerable importance in a
practical point of view, and their observance or neglect is noticed
with scrupulous exactness by the Indians. The want of inanimate
forms to such words as happy, sorrowful, brave, sick, &amp;c.,
creates no confusion, as inanimate nouns cannot, strictly speaking,
take upon themselves such qualities; and when they do&mdash;as
they sometimes do&mdash;by one of those extravagant figures of speech
which are used in their tales of transformations, the animate form
answers all purposes; for in these tales the whole material creation
may be clothed with animation. The rule, as exhibited in
practice, is limited, with sufficient accuracy, to the boundaries
prescribed by nature.</p>

<p>To avoid a repetition of forms, were the noun and the adjective
both to be employed in their usual relation, the latter is endowed
with a pronominal or substantive inflection; and the use of the
noun in its separate form is thus wholly superseded. Thus, <i>onishishin</i>,
a. i., and <i>onishishsha</i>, a. a., become <i>wänishishing</i>, "That
which is good or fair," and <i>wänishishid</i>, "He who is good or fair."
The following examples will exhibit this rule under each of its

<p>The animate forms, in these examples, will be recognized as
exhibiting a further extension of the rule, mentioned in the preceding
Inquiry, by which substantives are formed from the indicative
of the verb by a permutation of the vowels; and these
forms are likewise rendered plural in the manner there mentioned.
They also undergo changes to indicate the various persons. For
instance, <i>onishisha</i> is thus declined to mark the person:&mdash;</p>

<p>The inanimate forms, being without person, are simply rendered
plural by <i>in</i>, changing <i>maiskwaug</i> to <i>maiskwaug-in</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
The verbal signification which these forms assume, as indicated
in the words am, art, is, are, is to be sought in the permutative
change of the first syllable. Thus, <i>o</i> is changed to <i>wä</i>, <i>muk</i> to
<i>mäk</i>, <i>waub</i> to <i>wy-aub</i>, <i>ozau</i> to <i>wäzau</i>, <i>misk</i> to <i>maisk</i>, &amp;c. The pronoun,
as is usual in the double compounds, is formed wholly by
the inflections <i>eyaun</i>, <i>eyun</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The strong tendency of the adjective to assume a personal or
pronomico-substantive form, leads to the employment of many
words in a particular or exclusive sense; and, in any future practical
attempts with the language, it will be found greatly to facilitate
its acquisition, if the adjectives are arranged in distinct classes,
separated by this characteristic principle of their application.
The examples we have given are chiefly those which may be
considered strictly animate or inanimate, admit of double forms,
and are of general use. Many of the examples recorded in the
original manuscripts employed in these inquiries, are of a more
concrete character, and, at the same time, a more limited use.
Thus, <i>shaugwewe</i> is a weak person; <i>nökaugumme</i>, a weak drink;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
<i>nökaugwud</i>, a weak or soft piece of wood. <i>Sussägau</i> is fine, but
can only be applied to personal appearance; <i>beesau</i>, indicates fine
grains. <i>Keewushkwä</i> is giddy, and <i>keewushkwäbee</i>, giddy with
drink&mdash;both being restricted to the third person. <i>Söngun</i> and
<i>songizzi</i> are the personal and impersonal forms of strong, as
given above, but <i>mushkowaugumme</i> is strong drink. In like
manner, the two words for hard, as above, are restricted to solid
substances. <i>Sunnuhgud</i> is hard (to endure). <i>Waindud</i> is easy
(to perform). <i>Söngodää</i> is brave; <i>shaugedää</i>, cowardly; <i>keezhinghowizzi</i>,
active; <i>kizheekau</i>, swift; <i>onaunegoozzi</i>, lively; <i>minwaindum</i>,
happy; <i>gushkaindum</i>, sorrowful; but all these forms are confined
to the third person of the indicative, singular. <i>Pibbigwun</i> is
a rough or knotted substance; <i>pubbiggozzi</i>, a rough person. <i>Keenwau</i>
is long or tall (any solid mass). <i>Kaynozid</i> is a tall person.
<i>Tahkozid</i> a short person. <i>Wassayau</i> is light; <i>wassaubizzoo</i>, the
light of the eye; <i>wasshauzhä</i>, the light of a star or any luminous
body. <i>Keenau</i> is sharp; <i>keenaubikud</i>, a sharp knife or stone.
<i>Keezhaubikeday</i> is hot metal, a hot stove, &amp;c. <i>Keezhaugummeday</i>
is hot water. <i>Uubudgeetön</i> is useful, a useful thing. <i>Wauweeug</i>
is frivolous, anything frivolous in word or deed. <i>Tubbushish</i>
appears to be a general term for low. <i>Ishpimming</i> is high in the
air. <i>Ishpau</i> is applied to any high fixture, as a house, &amp;c. <i>Ishpaubikau</i>
is a high rock. <i>Taushkaubikau</i>, a split rock.</p>

<p>These combinations and limitations meet the inquirer at every
step; they are the current phrases of the language; they present
short, ready, and often beautiful modes of expression; and, as
they shed light both upon the idiom and genius of the language,
I shall not scruple to add further examples and illustrations.
Ask a Chippewa the name for a rock, and he will answer <i>awzhebik</i>.
The generic import of <i>awbik</i> has been explained. Ask him
the name for red rock, and he will answer <i>miskwaubik</i>; for white
rock, and he will answer <i>waubaubik</i>; for black rock, <i>mukkuddäwaubik</i>;
for yellow rock, <i>ozahwaubik</i>; for green rock, <i>ozhahwushkwaubik</i>;
for bright rock, <i>wassayaubik</i>; for smooth rock, <i>shoishkwaubik</i>,
&amp;c.&mdash;compounds in which the words red, white, black,
yellow, &amp;c., unite with <i>aubik</i>. Pursue this inquiry, and the following

<p>Add <i>bun</i> to these terms, and they are made to have passed
away; prefix <i>tah</i> to them, and their future appearance is indicated.
The word "is" in the translations, although marked with parentheses,
is not deemed wholly gratuitous. There is, strictly speaking,
an idea of existence given to these compounds, by the particle
<i>au</i>, in <i>aubic</i>, which seems to be indirectly a derivative from that
great and fundamental root of the language <i>Iau</i>. <i>Bik</i> is apparently
the radix of the expression for "rock."</p>

<p>Let this mode of interrogation be continued, and extended to
other adjectives, or the same adjectives applied to other objects,
and results equally regular and numerous will be obtained.

a black cloud; <i>waubahnokwut</i>, a white cloud; <i>ozahwushkwahnakwut</i>,
a blue cloud, &amp;c. <i>Neebe</i> is the specific term for water;

<p>From <i>minno</i>, and from <i>monaudud</i>, good and bad, are derived
the following terms: <i>Minnopogwud</i>, it tastes well; <i>minnopogoozzi</i>,
he tastes well; <i>mawzhepogwud</i>, it tastes bad; <i>mawzhepogoozzi</i>, he
tastes bad. <i>Minnomaugwud</i>, it smells good; <i>minnomaugoozzi</i>, he
smells good;_ mauzhemaugud_, it smells bad; <i>mauzhemaugoozzi</i>, he
smells bad. The inflections <i>gwud</i>, and <i>izzi</i>, here employed, are
clearly indicative, as in other combinations, of the words <i>it</i> and
<i>him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Baimwa</i>, is sound; <i>baimwäwa</i>, the passing sound; <i>minwäwa</i>, a
pleasant sound; <i>maunwäwa</i>, a disagreeable sound; <i>mudwayaushkau</i>,
the sound of waves dashing on the shore; <i>mudwayaunnemud</i>, the
sound of winds; <i>mudwayaukooshkau</i>, the sound of falling trees;
<i>mudwäkumigishin</i>, the sound of a person falling upon the earth;
<i>mudwaysin</i>, the sound of any inanimate mass falling on the earth.
These examples might be continued <i>ad infinitum</i>. Every modification
of circumstances, almost every peculiarity of thought, is expressed
by some modification of the orthography. Enough has
been given to prove that the adjective combines itself with the
substantive, the verb, and the pronoun, that the combinations thus
produced are numerous, afford concentrated modes of conveying
ideas, and oftentimes, happy turns of expression. Numerous and
prevalent as these forms are, they do not, however, preclude the
use of adjectives in their simple forms. The use of the one or
the other appears to be generally at the option of the speaker.
In most cases brevity or euphony dictates the choice. Usage results
from these applications of the principles. There may be rules
resting upon a broader basis; but if so, they do not appear to be
very obvious. Perhaps the simple adjectives are often employed
before verbs and nouns, in the first and second persons singular.</p>

<p>These expressions are put down promiscuously, embracing verbs
and nouns as they presented themselves, and without any effort
to support the opinion, which may or may not be correct, that
the elementary forms of the adjectives are most commonly required
before verbs and nouns in the first and second persons. The
English expression is thrown into Indian in the most natural
manner, and, of course, without always giving adjective for adjective
or noun for noun. Thus, God is rendered, not <i>monedo</i>, but
<i>Geezha monedo, merciful spirit</i>. Good luck is rendered by the
compound phrase, <i>shäwaindaugoozzegun</i>, indicating in a very general
sense, the influence of kindness or benevolence on <i>success in life</i>.
<i>Söngedää</i> is, alone, <i>a brave man</i>, and the word <i>kägät</i> prefixed, is an
adverb. In the expression "mild tobacco," the adjective is entirely
dispensed with in the Indian, the sense being sufficiently
rendered by the compound noun <i>appaukoozzegun</i>, which always
means the Indian weed or smoking mixture. <i>Ussämau</i>, on the
contrary, without the adjective, signifies pure tobacco. <i>Bikwukön</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
signifies blunt or lumpy-headed arrows; <i>assowaun</i>, is the barbed
arrow. <i>Kwonaudj kweeweezains</i> means, not simply "pretty boy,"
but <i>pretty little boy</i>; and there is no mode of using the word boy
but in this diminutive form, the word itself being a derivative
<i>kewewe coryugal</i>, with the regular diminutive in <i>ains</i>. <i>Onauneegoozzin</i>,
embraces the pronoun, verb, and adjective, <i>be thou cheerful</i>.
In the last phrase of the examples, "man" is rendered men (<i>inineewuy</i>)
in the translation, as the term <i>man</i> cannot be employed in
the general plural sense it conveys in this connection in the original.
The word "whiskey" is rendered by the compound phrase,
<i>ishködawaubo</i>, literally <i>fire-liquor</i>, a generic for all kinds of ardent
spirits.</p>

<p>These aberrations from the literal terms will convey some conceptions
of the difference of the two idioms, although, from the
limited nature and object of the examples, they will not indicate
the full extent of the difference. In giving anything like the
spirit of the original, much greater deviations in the written forms
must appear. And in fact, not only the structure of the language,
but the mode and <i>order of thought</i> of the Indians is so essentially
different, that any attempts to preserve the English idiom, to give
letter for letter, and word for word, must go far to render the
translation pure nonsense.</p>

<p>2. Varied as the adjective is in its changes, it has no comparative
inflection. A Chippewa cannot say that one substance is
hotter or colder than another, or of two or more substances unequally
heated, that this or that is the hottest or coldest, without
employing adverbs or accessory adjectives; and it is accordingly
by adverbs and accessory adjectives that the degrees of comparison
are expressed.</p>

<p><i>Pimmaudizziwin</i>, is a very general substantive expression, indicating
the <i>tenor of being or life</i>. <i>Izzhewäbizziwin</i>, is a term near
akin to it, but more appropriately applied to the <i>acts</i>, <i>conduct</i>,
<i>manner</i>, or <i>personal deportment</i> of life. Hence the expressions&mdash;</p>

<p>To form the positive degree of comparison from these terms,
<i>minno</i>, good, and <i>mudjee</i>, bad, are introduced between the pronoun
and verb, giving rise to some permutations of the vowels and consonants,
which affect the sound only. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>To place these forms in the comparative degree, <i>nahwudj</i>, <i>more</i>,
is prefixed to the adjective; and the superlative is denoted by
<i>mahmowee</i>, an adverb or an adjective as it is variously applied, but
the meaning of which is, in this connection, <i>most</i>. The degrees of
comparison may be, therefore, set down as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In these examples, the declinable adjectives are rendered negative
in <i>see</i>; the indeclinable, remain as simple adjuncts to the
verbs; and the <i>latter</i> put on the negative form.</p>

<p>4. In the hints and remarks which have now been furnished
respecting the Chippewa adjective, its powers and inflections
have been shown to run parallel with those of the substantive, in
its separation into animates and inanimates; in having the pronominal
inflections; in taking an inflection for tense&mdash;a topic
which, by the way, has been very cursorily passed over&mdash;and in
the numerous modifications to form the compounds. This parallelism
has also been intimated to hold good with respect to number&mdash;a
subject deeply interesting in itself, as it has its analogy
only in the ancient languages&mdash;and it was therefore deemed best
to defer giving examples, till they could be introduced without
abstracting the attention from other points of discussion.</p>

<p><i>Minno</i> and <i>mudjee</i>, good and bad, being of the limited number
of personal adjectives which modern usage permits being applied,
although often improperly applied to inanimate objects, they, as
well as a few other adjectives, form exceptions to the use of
number. Whether we say "a good man" or "a bad man,"
"good men" or "bad men," the words <i>minno</i> and <i>mudjee</i> remain
the same. But all the declinable and coalescing adjectives&mdash;adjectives
which join on, and, as it were, <i>melt into</i> the body of the
substantive&mdash;take the usual plural inflections, and are governed
by the same rules in regard to their use, as the substantive; personal
adjectives requiring personal plurals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Peculiar circumstances are supposed to exist in order to render
the use of the adjective, in this connection with the noun,
necessary and proper. But, in ordinary instances, as the narration
of events, the noun would precede the adjective; and
oftentimes, particularly where a second allusion to objects previously
named became necessary, the compound expressions
would be used. Thus, instead of saying "the yellow bee,"
<i>wazzahwizzid</i> would distinctly convey the idea of that insect, <i>had
the species been before named</i>. Under similar circumstances, <i>kain-waukoozzid</i>,
<i>agausheid</i>, <i>söngaunemud</i>, <i>mushkowaunemud</i>, would respectively
signify, "a tall tree," "a small fly," "a strong wind,"
"a hard wind." And these terms would become plural in <i>jig</i>,
which, as before mentioned, is a mere modification of <i>ig</i>, one of
the five general animate plural inflections of the language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
<i>Kägät wahwinaudj abbenöjeeug</i>, is an expression indicating they
are <i>very handsome children</i>. But <i>beeweezheewug monetösug</i> denotes
<i>small insects</i>. <i>Minno neewugizzi</i>, is "good tempered," "he is good
tempered." <i>Mawshininewugizzi</i>, is "bad tempered," both having
their plural in <i>wug</i>. <i>Nin nuneenahwaindum</i>, "I am lonesome."
<i>Nin nuneenahwaindaumin</i>, "we (excluding you) are lonesome."
<i>Waweea</i>, is a term generally used to express the adjective sense
of round. <i>Kwy</i>, is the scalp; <i>weewikwy</i>, his scalp. Hence, <i>weewukwon</i>,
"hat," <i>wayweewukwonid</i>, "a wearer of the hat;" and its
plural, <i>wayweewukwonidjig</i>, "wearers of the hats"&mdash;the usual term
applied to Europeans, or white men generally. These examples
go to prove that under every form in which the adjective can be
traced, whether in its simplest or most compound state, it is susceptible
of number.</p>

<p>These inflections can be carried as high as they can compute
numbers. They count decimally. After reaching ten, they repeat,
ten and one, ten and two, &amp;c. to twenty. Twenty is a compound
signifying two tens; thirty, three tens, &amp;c.; a mode which
is carried up to one hundred&mdash;<i>n'goodwak</i>. <i>Wak</i> then becomes
the word of denomination, combining with the names of the digits
until they reach a thousand, <i>meetauswauk</i>, literally <i>ten hundred</i>.
Here a new compound term is introduced, made by prefixing
twenty to the last denominator, <i>neeshtonnah duswak</i>, which doubles
the last term, thirty triples it, forty quadruples it, &amp;c. till the
computation reaches to ten thousand, <i>n'goodwak dushing n'goodwak</i>,

of all certain computation. The term <i>gitshee</i> (great), prefixed
to the last denomination, leaves the number indefinite.</p>

third, fourth, &amp;c. They can only further say, <i>nittum</i>, first, and

<p>Pronouns are buried, if we may so say, in the structure of
the verb. In tracing them back to their primitive forms, through
the almost infinite variety of modifications which they assume, in
connection with the verb, substantive, and adjective, it will facilitate
analysis to group them into preformative and subformative,
which include the terms that have already been made use of&mdash;pronominal
prefixes, and suffixes&mdash;and which admit of the further
distinction of separable and inseparable. By separable, is intended
those forms which have a meaning by themselves, and are thus
distinguished from the inflective and subformative pronouns, and
pronominal particles, significant only in connection with another
word.</p>

<p>1. Of the first class, are the personal pronouns <i>Neen</i> (I), <i>Keen</i>
(Thou), and <i>Ween</i> or <i>O</i> (He or She). They are declined, to form
the plural persons, in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here the plural persons are formed by a numerical inflection
of the singular. The double plural of the first person, of which
both the rule and examples have been incidentally given in the
remarks on the substantive, is one of those peculiarities of the
language which may, perhaps, serve to aid in a comparison of it
with other dialects, kindred and foreign. As a mere conventional
agreement for denoting whether the person addressed be included
or excluded, it may be regarded as an advantage to the language.
It enables the speaker, by the change of a single consonant, to
make a full and clear discrimination, and relieves the narration
from doubts and ambiguity, where doubts and ambiguity would
otherwise often exist. On the other hand, by accumulating distinctions,
it loads the memory with grammatical forms, and opens
a door for improprieties of speech. We are not aware of any
inconveniences in the use of a general plural; but, in the Indian,
it would produce confusion. And it is, perhaps, to that cautious
desire of personal discrimination, which is so apparent in the
structure of the language, that we should look for the reason of
the duplicate forms of this word. Once established, however,
and both the distinction, and the necessity of a constant and
strict attention to it, are very obvious and striking. How shall
he address the Deity? If he say, "Our Father who art in
heaven," the inclusive form of <i>our</i> makes the Almighty one of
the suppliants, or family. If he use the exclusive form, it throws
him out of the family, and may embrace every living being but
the Deity. Yet, neither of these forms can be used very well in
prayer, as they cannot be applied directly <i>to</i> the object addressed.
It is only when speaking <i>of</i> the Deity, under the name of father,
to other persons, that the inclusive and exclusive forms of the
word <i>our</i> can be used. The dilemma may be obviated by the
use of a compound descriptive phrase, <i>Wä ö se mig o yun</i>, signifying,
"Thou, who art the father of all," or "universal father."
In practice, however, the question is cut short by those persons
who have embraced Christianity. It has seemed to them that,
by the use of either of the foregoing terms, the Deity would be
thrown into too remote a relation to them; and I have observed
that in prayer they invariably address Him by the term used by
children for the father of a family&mdash;that is, <i>nosa</i>, "my father."</p>

<p>The other personal pronouns undergo some peculiar changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
when employed as preformatives before nouns and verbs, which
it is important to remark. Thus <i>neen</i>, is sometimes rendered <i>ne</i>,
or <i>nin</i>, and sometimes <i>nim</i>. <i>Keen</i>, is rendered <i>ke</i>, or <i>kin</i>. In
compound words, the mere signs of the first and second pronouns,
<i>N</i> and <i>K</i>, are employed. The use of <i>ween</i> is limited; and
the third person, singular and plural, is generally indicated by
the sign <i>O</i>.</p>

<p>The particle <i>suh</i>, added to the complete forms of the disjunctive
pronouns, imparts a verbal sense to them; and appears, in this
instance, to be a succedaneum for the substantive verb. Thus

<p>In the translation of these expressions, "man" is used as synonymous
with "person." If the specific term <i>inine</i> had been
introduced, in the original, the meaning thereby conveyed would
be, in this particular connection, "I am a man," with respect to
<i>courage</i>, &amp;c. in opposition to effeminacy. It would not be simply
declarative of <i>corporeal existence</i>, but of existence in a <i>particular
state or condition</i>.</p>

<p>These examples are cited as exhibiting the manner in which
the <i>prefixed</i> and preformative pronouns are employed, both in
their full and contracted forms. To denote possession, nouns
specifying the things possessed are required; and, what would
not be anticipated had not full examples of this species of declension
been given in another place, the purposes of distinction are
not affected by a simple change of the pronoun, as <i>I</i> to <i>mine</i>, &amp;c.,
but by a subformative inflection of the <i>noun</i>, which is thus made
to have a reflective operation upon the pronoun speaker. It is
believed that sufficient examples of this rule, in all the modifications
of inflection, have been given under the head of the substantive.
But as the substantives employed to elicit these modifications
were exclusively <i>specific</i> in their meaning, it, may be
proper here, in further illustration of an important principle, to
present a generic substantive under their compound forms.</p>

<p>I have selected for this purpose one of the primitives. <span class="smcap">IE-AU´</span>,
is the abstract term for matter. It is in the animate form. Its
inanimate correspondent is <span class="smcap">IE-EE´</span>. These are two important roots.
And they are found in combination, in a very great number of
derivative words. It will be sufficient here, to show their connection
with the pronoun, in the production of a class of terms
in very general use.</p>

<p>In these forms the noun is singular throughout. To render it
plural, as well as the pronoun, the appropriate general plurals <i>ug</i>
and <i>un</i>, or <i>ig</i> and <i>in</i>, must be superadded. But it must be borne
in mind, in making these additions, "that the plural inflection to
inanimate nouns (which have no objective case), forms the objective
case to animate, which have no number in the third person."
(p. 461.) The particle <i>un</i>, therefore, which is the appropriate
plural for the inanimate nouns in these examples, is only the objective
mark of the animate.</p>

<p>The plural of I, is <i>naun</i>, the plural of thou and he, <i>wau</i>. But
as these inflections would not coalesce smoothly with the possessive
inflections, the connective vowels <i>i</i> and <i>e</i> are prefixed, making
the plural of I, <i>inaun</i>, and of thou, &amp;c., <i>ewau</i>.</p>

<p>If we strike from these declensions the root <span class="smcap">IE</span>, leaving its animate
and inanimate forms AU and EE, and adding the plural of
the noun, we shall then, taking the <i>animate</i> declension as an instance,
have the following formula of the pronominal declensions:</p>

<p>To render this formula of general use, six variations (five in
addition to the above) of the possessive inflection are required,
corresponding to the six classes of substantives, whereby <i>aum</i>
would be changed to _äm_, <i>eem</i>, <i>im</i>, _öm_, and <i>oom</i>, conformably to the
examples heretofore given in treating of the substantive. The
objective inflection would also be sometimes changed to <i>een</i>, and
sometimes to <i>oan</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus indicated the mode of distinguishing the person,
number, relation, and gender, or what is deemed its technical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>equivalent, the mutations words undergo, not to mark the distinctions
of <i>sex</i>, but the presence or absence of <i>vitality</i>, I shall
now advert to the inflections which the pronouns take for <i>tense</i>,
or rather to form the auxiliary verbs, have, had, shall, will, may,
&amp;c.; a very curious and important principle, and one which clearly
demonstrates that no part of speech has escaped the transforming
genius of the language. Not only are the three great modifications
of time accurately marked in the verbal form of the Chippewas,
but, by the inflection of the pronoun, they are enabled to
indicate some of the oblique tenses, and thereby to conjugate
their verbs with accuracy and precision.</p>

<p>The particle <i>gee</i> added to the first, second, and third person
singular, of the present tense, changes them to the perfect past,
rendering I, thou, he, I did, have, or had; thou didst, hast, or
hadst; he or she did, have, or had. If <i>gah</i> be substituted for <i>gee</i>,
the first future tense is formed, and the perfect past added to the
first future, forms the conditional future. As the eye may prove
an auxiliary in the comprehension of forms which are not familiar,
the following tabular arrangement of them is presented.</p>

by a retrospective action of the pronominal inflections of the

<p>These pronouns are exclusively employed as suffixes, and as
suffixes to the descriptive compound substantives, adjectives, and

<p>2. <i>Relative Pronouns.</i>&mdash;In a language which provides for the
distinction of person by particles prefixed or suffixed to the verb,
it will scarcely be expected that separate and independent relative
pronouns should exist, or if such are to be found, their use, as separate
parts of speech, must, it will have been anticipated, be quite
limited; limited to simple interrogatory forms of expression, and
not applicable to the indicative or declaratory. Such will be
found to be the fact in the language under review; and it will be
perceived from the subjoined examples, that in all instances requiring
the relative pronoun <i>who</i>, other than the simple interrogatory
forms, this relation is indicated by the inflections of the
verb, or adjective, &amp;c. Nor does there appear to be any declension
of the separate pronoun corresponding to <i>whose</i> and <i>whom</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>Ahwaynain</i>, may be said to be uniformly employed
in the sense of <i>who</i>, under the limitations we have mentioned.

<p>We reply to this answer of the native speaker, that the particle
<i>kau</i> prefixed to a verb, denotes the past tense; that in the former
series of terms in which this particle appears, the verbs are in
the perfect indicative, and in the latter, they are in the present
indicative, marking the difference only between <i>sent</i> and <i>send</i>,
<i>spoke</i> and <i>speak</i>, &amp;c.; and that there is absolutely no relative pronoun
in either series of terms. We further observe, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
personal pronoun <i>ween</i>, prefixed to the first set of terms, may be
prefixed, with equal propriety, to the second set, and that its use
or disuse is perfectly optional with the speaker, as he may wish
to give additional energy or emphasis to the expression. To these
positions, after reflection, discussion, and examination, we receive
an assent, and thus the uncertainty is terminated.</p>

<p>We now wish to apply the principle thus elicited to verbs
causative, and to other compound terms&mdash;to the adjective verbs,
for instance&mdash;and to the other verbal compound expressions, in
which the objective and the nominative persons are incorporated
as a part of the verb, and are not prefixes to it. This may be
shown in the causative verb&mdash;</p>

<p>The basis of these compounds is <i>minno</i>, "good," and <i>aindum</i>,
"the mind." Hence, <i>minwaindum</i>, "he happy." The adjective,
in this connection, cannot be translated "good," but its effect
upon the noun is to denote that state of the mind which is at rest
with itself. The first change from this simple compound, is to
give the adjective a verbal form; and this is effected by a permutation
of the vowels of the first syllable&mdash;a rule of very extensive
application&mdash;and by which, in the present instance, the phrase
"he happy," is changed to "he makes happy," (<i>mainwaindum</i>.)
The next step is to add the suffix personal pronouns, <i>id</i>, <i>ik</i>, <i>aud</i>,
&amp;c., rendering the expressions, "he makes <i>me</i> happy," &amp;c. But,
in adding these increments, the vowel <i>e</i> is thrown between the
adjective-verb and the pronoun suffixed, making the expression,
not <i>mainwaindum-yun</i>, but <i>mainwaindum ëyun</i>. Generally, the
vowel e, in this situation, is a connective, or introduced merely
for the sake of euphony. And those who maintain that it is here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
employed as a personal pronoun, and that the relative <i>who</i> is implied
by the final inflection, overlook the inevitable inference,
that if the marked <i>e</i> stands for <i>me</i> in the first phrase, it must
stand for <i>thee</i> in the second, <i>he</i> in the third, <i>us</i> in the fourth, &amp;c.
As to the meaning and office of the final inflections <i>id</i>, <i>ik</i>, &amp;c.,
whatever they may, in an involuted sense, <i>imply</i>, it is quite clear,
by turning to the list of <i>suffixed personal pronouns</i>, and <i>animate
plurals</i>, that they mark the persons, I, thou, he, &amp;c., we, ye,
they, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Take, for example, <i>minwaindumëigowaud</i>, "he (who) makes
them happy." Of this compound, <i>minwaindum</i>, as before shown,
signifies "he makes happy." But as the verb is in the singular
number, it implies that but <i>one person</i> is made happy; and the
suffixed personal pronouns <i>singular</i>, mark the distinctions between
<i>me</i>, <i>thee</i>, and <i>he</i>, or <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Minwaindum-e-ig</i> is the verb plural, and implies that several
persons are made happy; and, in like manner, the suffixed personal
pronouns <i>plural</i>, mark the distinctions between we, ye,
they, &amp;c.; for it is a rule of the language, that a strict concordance
must exist between the number of the verb and the number
of the pronoun. The termination of the verb consequently
always indicates whether there be one or many objects to which
its energy is directed. And as animate verbs can be applied
only to animate objects, the numerical inflections of the verb are
understood to mark the number of persons. But this number is
indiscriminate, and leaves the sense vague until the pronominal
suffixes are superadded. Those who, therefore, contend for the
<i>sense</i> of the relative pronoun "who" being given in the last-mentioned
phrase, and all phrases similarly formed by a succedaneum,
contend for something like the following form of translation:
"He makes them happy&mdash;him!" or "Him&mdash;he (meaning
'who') makes them happy."</p>

<p>These words are not always used merely to ascertain the object,
but often, perhaps always, when the object is present to the
sight, have a substantive meaning, and are used without the
noun. It creates no uncertainty, if a man be standing at some
distance to say, <i>Ah-ow</i>; or if a canoe be lying at some distance,
to say, <i>Eh-eu</i>; the meaning is clearly, that <i>person</i>, or that <i>canoe</i>,
whether the noun be added or not. Or, if there be two animate
objects standing together, or two inanimate objects lying together,
the words <i>maumig</i> (a.), or <i>maumin</i> (i.), if they be near, or <i>ig-eu</i>,
(a.), or <i>in-eu</i> (i.), if they be distant, are equally expressive of the
<i>materiality</i> of the objects, as well as their relative position. Under
other circumstances the noun would be required, as where two
animate objects of diverse character&mdash;a man and a horse for instance&mdash;were
standing near each other; or a canoe and a package
of goods were lying near each other&mdash;and, in fact, under all circumstances&mdash;the
noun <i>may</i> be used after the demonstrative pronoun,
without violating any rule of grammar, although not without the
imputation, in many instances, of being over-formal and unnecessarily
minute. What is deemed redundant, however, in oral use,
and amongst a people who supply much by sight and gesticulation,
becomes quite necessary in writing the language; and, in
the following sentences, the substantive is properly employed

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
22. <span class="smcap">Unio ebenus</span>, <i>Lea</i>. Upper Mississippi, between Prairie du
Chien and Lake Pepin.</p>

<p>23. <span class="smcap">Unio gibbosus</span>, <i>Barnes</i>. St. Croix River, Upper Mississippi,</p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap">Unio rectus</span>, <i>Lamarck</i>. <span class="smcap">U. prælongus</span>, <i>Barnes</i>. Upper
Mississippi, from Prairie du Chien to Lake Pepin, and the River
St. Croix. The specimens collected by Mr. Schoolcraft, vary
much in the color of the nacre. Some have it entirely white,
others rose purple, and others entirely of a very fine dark salmon
color. This species inhabits the St. Lawrence as far east as
Montreal.</p>

<p>25. <span class="smcap">Unio siliquoideus</span>, <i>Barnes</i>, and <span class="smcap">U. inflatus</span>, <i>Barnes</i>.
Upper Mississippi, between Prairie du Chien and Lake Pepin.
Large, ponderous, and the epidermis finely rayed.</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap">Unio complanatus</span>, <i>Lea</i>. <span class="smcap">U. purpureus</span>, <i>Say</i>. Lake
Vaseux, St. Mary's River. Lake Vaseux is an expansion of the
River St. Mary, a tributary of the upper lakes. This shell does
not appear to exist in any of the streams flowing into the Mississippi.</p>

<p>27. <span class="smcap">Unio crassus</span>, <i>Say</i>. Upper Mississippi, Prairie du Chien.</p>

<p>28. <span class="smcap">Unio radiatus</span>, <i>Barnes</i>. Lake Vaseux. The specimen is
old and imperfect, but I believe it to be the <span class="smcap">U. radiatus</span> of our
conchologists, which is common in Lake Champlain and also inhabits
the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap">Unio occidens</span>, <i>Lea</i>. <span class="smcap">U. ventricosus</span>, <i>Say</i>, Am. Con. <span class="smcap">U.
ventricosus</span>, <i>Barnes?</i> Wisconsin and St. Croix Rivers, and Shell
Lake. Epidermis variously colored, and marked with numerous
rays.</p>

<p>30. <span class="smcap">Unio ventricosus</span>, <i>Barnes</i>. Upper Mississippi, from Prairie
du Chien to Lake Pepin and Shell Lake. The varieties of this,
and the preceding pass insensibly into each other. Those from
Shell Lake are of extraordinary size.</p>

<p>31. <span class="smcap">Unio alatus</span>, <i>Say</i>. <span class="smcap">Symphynota alata</span>, <i>Lea</i>. Upper
Mississippi, and Shell Lake. Found also in Lake Champlain, by
the late Mr. Barnes.</p>

<p>32. <span class="smcap">Unio gracilis</span>, <i>Barnes</i>. <span class="smcap">Symphynota gracilis</span>, <i>Lea</i>.
Upper Mississippi, and Shell Lake. The specimens brought by
Mr. Schoolcraft are larger and more beautiful than I have seen
from any other locality.</p>

<p class="hanging indent">
1. <i>A Report on the Existence of Deposits of Copper in the Geological
Basin of Lake Superior.</i> By Dr. <span class="smcap">D. Houghton</span>.</p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Fredonia, N. Y.</span>, November 14, 1831.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In fulfilment of the duties assigned to me in the late expedition
into the Indian country, under the direction of H. R.
Schoolcraft, Esq., Indian Agent, I would beg leave to transmit
to you the following observations relative to the existence of
copper in the country bordering on the southern shore of Lake
Superior.</p>

<p>It is without doubt true that this subject has long been viewed
with an interest far beyond its actual merit. Each mass of native
copper which this country has produced, however insulated, or
however it may have been separated from its original position,
appears to have been considered a sure indication of the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
of that metal in beds; and hence we occasionally see, upon maps
of that section of our country, particular portions marked as containing
"copper mines," where no copper now exists. But, while
it is certain that a combination of circumstances has served to
mislead the public mind with regard to the geological situation
and existing quantity of that metal, it is no less certain that a
greater quantity of insulated native copper has been discovered
upon the borders of Lake Superior, than in any other equal portion
of North America.</p>

<p>Among the masses of native copper which have engaged the
attention of travellers in this section of country, one, which from
its great size was early noticed, is situated on the Ontonagon
River, a stream which empties its waters into the southern part
of Lake Superior, 331 miles above the Falls of the Ste. Marie.
The Ontonagon River is, with some difficulty, navigable by batteaux
36 miles, at which place, by the union of two smaller
streams&mdash;one from an easterly and the other from a westerly
direction&mdash;the main stream is formed. The mass of copper is
situated on the western fork, at a distance of six or eight miles
from the junction.</p>

<p>The face of the country through the upper half of the distance
from Lake Superior is uneven, and the irregularity is given it by
hills of marly clay, which occasionally rise quite abruptly to the
height of one or two hundred feet. No rock was observed <i>in
situ</i>, except in one place, where, for a distance, the red sandstone
was observed, forming the bed of the river.</p>

<p>The mass of copper lies, partly covered by water, directly at
the foot of a clay hill, from which, together with numerous
boulders of the primitive rocks, it has undoubtedly been washed
by the action of the water of the river. Although it is completely
insulated, there is much to interest in its examination. Its largest
surface measures three and a half by four feet, and this, which is
of malleable copper, is kept bright by the action of the water,
and has the usual appearance of that metal when worn. To one
surface is attached a small quantity of rock, singularly bound
together by threads of copper, which pass through it in all directions.
This rock, although many of its distinctive characters are
lost, is evidently a dark colored serpentine, with small interspersed
masses of milky quartz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
The mass of copper is so situated as to afford but little that
would enable us to judge of its original geological position. In
examining the eastern fork of the river, I discovered small water-worn
masses of trap-rock, in which were specks of imbedded
carbonate of copper and copper black; and with them were occasionally
associated minute specks of serpentine, in some respects
resembling that which is attached to the large mass of copper;
and facts would lead us to infer that the trap formation which
appears on Lake Superior east of the Ontonagon River, crosses
this section of country at or near the source of that river, and at
length forms one of the spurs of the Porcupine Mountains.</p>

<p>Several smaller masses of insulated native copper have been
discovered on the borders of Lake Superior, but that upon Ontonagon
River is the only one which is now known to remain.</p>

<p>At as early a period as before the American Revolution, an
English mining company directed their operations to the country
bordering on Lake Superior, and Ontonagon River was one point
to which their attention was immediately directed. Traces of a
shaft, sunk in the clay hill, near a mass of copper, are still visible&mdash;a
memento of ignorance and folly.</p>

<p>Operations were also commenced on the southern shore of Lake
Superior, near the mouth of a small stream, which, from that
circumstance, is called Miners' River. Parts of the names of the
miners, carved upon the sandstone rock at the mouth of the river,
are still visible. What circumstance led to the selection of this
spot does not now appear. No mineral traces are at this day
perceptible, except occasional discolorations of the sandstone rock
by what is apparently a mixture of the carbonates of iron and
copper; and this is only to be observed where water, holding in
solution an extremely minute portion of these salts, has trickled
slowly over those rocks.</p>

<p>It does not, in fact, appear that the red sandstone, which constitutes
the principal rock formation of the southern shore of
Lake Superior, is in any instance metalliferous in any considerable
degree. If this be true, it would require but little reflection
to convince one of the inexpediency of conducting mining operations
at either of the points selected for that purpose; and it is
beyond a doubt true, that the company did not receive the least
inducement to continue their labors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
In addition to these masses of native copper, an ore of that
metal has long been known to the lake traders as the green rock,
in which the characteristic substances are the green and blue carbonates
of copper, accompanied by copper black. It is situated
upon Keweena Point, 280 miles above the falls of the Ste. Marie.
The ore is embraced by what is apparently a recently formed
crag; and, although it is of a kind and so situated as to make an
imposing appearance, there is little certainty of its existence in
large quantities in this formation. The ore forms a thin covering
to the pebbles of which the body of the rock is composed,
and is rarely observed in masses separate from it. The crag is
composed of angular fragments of trap-rock, and the formation is
occasionally traversed by broad and continuous belts of calc. spar,
here and there tinged with copper. Although the ore was not
observed in any considerable quantity, except at one point, it
apparently exists in minute specks through a greater part of the
crag formation, which extends several miles, forming the shore
of the lake.</p>

<p>This examination of the crag threw new interest upon the trap
formation, which had been first observed to take the place of the
sandstone at the bottom of a deep bay, called Montreal Bay, on
the easterly side of Keweena Point. The trap-rock continues for
a few miles, when the crag before noticed appears to lie directly
upon it, and to form the extremity of the point; the crag, in turn,
disappears, and the trap-rock is continued for a distance of six or
eight miles upon the westerly side of the point, when the sandstone
again reappears.</p>

<p>The trap-rock is of a compact granular texture, occasionally
running into the amygdaloid and toadstone varieties, and is rich
in imbedded minerals, such as amethystine quartz, smoky quartz,
carnelian, chalcedony, agate, &amp;c., together with several of the ores
of copper. Traces of copper ore in the trap-rock were first
noticed on the easterly side of Keweena Point, and near the commencement
of the trap formation. This ore, which is an impure
copper black, was observed in a vein of variable thickness, but
not in any part exceeding two and a half inches. It is sufficiently
compact and hard to receive a firm polish, but it is rather disposed
to break into small irregular masses. A specimen furnished,
upon analysis, 47.5 per cent. of pure copper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
On the western side of Keweena Point, the same ore appears
under different circumstances, being disseminated through the
body of the trap-rock, in grains varying in size from a pin's head
to a pea. Although many of these grains are wholly copper black,
they are occasionally only depositions of the mineral upon specks
of carnelian, chalcedony, or agate, or are more frequently composed,
in part, of what is apparently an imperfect steatite. The
ore is so connected with, and so much resembles in color the
rock, of which it may be said to be a constituent part, that they
might easily, during a hasty examination, be confounded. A
random specimen of the rock furnished, upon analysis, 3.2 per
cent. of pure copper. The rock continues combined with that
mineral for nearly the space of three miles. Extremely thin veins
of copper black were observed to traverse this same rock; and
in enlargements of these were discovered several masses of amorphous
native copper. The latter mineral appeared in two forms&mdash;the
one consisting of compact and malleable masses, varying
from four to ten ounces each; and the other, of specks and fasciculi
of pure copper, binding together confused masses of copper green,
and partially disintegrated trap-rock; the latter was of several
pounds' weight. Each variety was closely embraced by the rock,
although the action of the water upon the rock had occasionally
exposed to view points of the metal. In addition to the accompanying
copper green, which was in a disintegrated state, small
specks of the oxide of copper were associated in most of the native
specimens.</p>

<p>Circumstances would not permit an examination of any portion
of the trap formation, except that bordering directly upon the lake.
But facts would lead us to infer that that formation extends from
one side of Keweena Point to the other, and that a range of thickly
wooded hills, which traverses the point, is based upon, if not formed
of that rock. An Indian information, which, particularly upon such
a subject, must be adopted with caution, would sanction the opinion
that the prominent constituents are the same wherever the rock is
observed.</p>

<p>After having duly considered the facts which are presented, I
would not hesitate to offer, as an opinion, that the trap-rock formation
was the original source of the masses of copper which have
been observed in the country bordering on Lake Superior; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
that, at the present day, examinations for the ores of copper could
not be made in that country with hopes of success, except in the
trap-rock itself; which rock is not certainly known to exist upon
any place upon Lake Superior, other than Keweena Point.</p>

<p>If this opinion be a correct one, the cause of, failure of the
mining company in this region is rendered plain. Having considered
each insulated mass of pure metal as a true indication of
the existence of a bed in the vicinity, operations were directed to
wrong points; when, having failed to realize their anticipations,
the project was abandoned without further actual investigation.
We would be induced to infer that no attempts were made to
learn the original source of the metal which was discovered, and
thus, while the attention was drawn to insulated masses, the ores,
ordinary in appearance, but more important <i>in sitû</i>, were neglected;
and perhaps, from the close analogy in appearance to the rock with
which they were associated, no distinction was observed.</p>

<p>What quantity of ore the trap-rock of Keweena Point may be
capable of producing, can only be determined by minute and
laborious examination. The indications which were presented
by a hasty investigation are here embodied, and with deference
submitted to your consideration.</p>

2. <i>Remarks on the Occurrence of Native Silver and Ores of Silver
in the Stratification of the Basins of Lakes Huron and Superior.</i>
By <span class="smcap">Henry R. Schoolcraft</span>.</p>

<p>Traces of this metal which have been found in the drift and
boulder stratum of both Lakes Huron and Superior, indicate the
existence of the metal in place. During my residence at St. Mary's,
two specimens of its occurrence were brought to my notice. The
first of these consisted of points of native silver in a moderately
large mass of native copper, found in 1823, near the entrance of
the <i>Nama</i> or Sturgeon River into Keweena Lake, of the large
peninsula of that name, in Lake Superior. Like the majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
such masses of the region, it had no adhering portion of rock or
vein stone, from which a judgment might be formed of its original
position.</p>

<p>I had, the prior year, set up my mineralogical cabinet in my
office, and stated to the Indians, who roved over large tracts, my
solicitude to collect specimens of the mineral productions of the
country of every description, and, indeed, of its zoology, always
acknowledging their comity, in bringing me specimens in any
department of natural history, by some small present; and I
found this to be a means of extending my inquiries.</p>

<p>Subsequently, I received a boulder specimen from the shores of
Lake Huron, containing veins of native silver. Part of the
metal had been detached. I submitted these specimens to the
Lyceum of Natural History at New York, in 1825. The following
remarks are taken from their annals.</p>

<p><i>Mineralogical and Chemical Characters.</i>&mdash;By examining this mineral,
it will be perceived to possess the color, lustre, malleability,
and other obvious characters of native silver. It is so soft as to be
easily cut by the knife; and in a state of purity which permits it
to spread under the hammer. These characters serve to distinguish
it from antimonial silver, which is not <i>malleable</i>; from native
antimony which tarnishes on exposure, &amp;c. The metal occurs in
thin, massive veins in the rock. These veins sometimes intersect,
but never cross each other. It is also disseminated in small particles
through the stone, or spread in flattened masses over its
surface. Some of these masses were detached by the discoverer,
but have been preserved, and are presented to the Lyceum with
the more solid and undisturbed portions.</p>

<p>By submitting a small portion of the metal to the action of
nitric acid, I obtained an imperfect solution. On repeating the
experiment, and adding a little sulphuric acid, the action was more
brisk, and a clear and apparently perfect solution effected. By
standing, however, a pulpy, white precipitate appeared at the bottom
of the glass. This was collected and submitted to the action
of the blowpipe, on a basis of charcoal. The result gave a number
of minute, metallic globules, possessing greater lustre, malleability,
and ductility, than the original mass. I repeated the latter
experiment, adding to the nitro-sulphuric solution muriate of soda.
A more perfect precipitation of the white powder was effected;
but the results with the blowpipe remained the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
<i>Geognostic Position.</i>&mdash;It is a rolled mass. An opinion of the
specific character of the rock may be dubious, from the smallness
of the specimen. It appears to have been detached from a stratum
of gneiss, and is essentially composed of quartz. The blackish
color of some parts of this latter mineral would, at first glance,
lead us to attribute this color to the presence of hornblende; but,
on closer examination, it will be perceived to be owing to a dark-colored
steatite, which, in certain parts of the rock, is well developed,
soft, and easily cut. A little calcspar is intermingled
with the steatite.</p>

<p><i>Locality.</i>&mdash;I am indebted to the politeness of Lieut. Lewis S.
Johnston, of the British Indian Department, at Malden (U. C.),
for the opportunity of adding this specimen to the mineralogical
cabinet of the Lyceum. This gentleman, as he informed me, obtained
it from an Indian, who picked it up on the southeastern
shores of Lake Huron, near Point aux Barques, in Michigan
Territory. That part of Lake Huron was cursorily examined by
me, in the year 1820, in the course of the expedition conducted
by Gov. Cass, through the upper lakes, &amp;c. I consider it remarkable,
even in a region abounding in rolled rocks, for the
great number and variety of granite, gneiss, hornblende, and trap
boulders, scattered along the shores of the lake. The water here
is generally shallow and dangerous to approach in vessels; these
boulder stones sometimes extending and presenting themselves
above water for a mile or more from land. But we could not
satisfy ourselves by an examination necessarily partial, that either
of the primitive species mentioned, existed there in any other
condition than as rolled masses, or displacements of rock strata,
contiguous, perhaps, but not observed. Dr. Bigsby has informed
me, that he observed the gneiss <i>in sitû</i>, on the northwestern shores
of this lake. The nearest rock in place, and that which in fact
constitutes the abraded and caverned promontory of Point aux
Barques, is gray sandstone.</p>

<p>The occurrence of this metal in the copper-bearing and other
metalliferous rocks of this region, may be confidently affirmed.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[273]</a></p>

Black Rocks. At the latter, native copper is one of the constituents

4. <i>Geological Outline of the Taquimenon Valley of Lake Superior.</i>
By <span class="smcap">Henry R. Schoolcraft</span>.</p>

<p>The River Takquimenon originates on a plateau between the
northern shores of Lake Michigan and the southeastern coast of
Lake Superior. At a central point on this plateau, there lies a
lake of moderate size, which, in the translated Indian phrase, is
called Heartsblood Lake. A little to the west of this lake, and,
perhaps, connected with it, originates the head stream of the
North Manistic River of Lake Michigan, running southwest.
Towards the northeast the Takwymenon takes its way, winding
through level grassy plains, till it reaches the rim of the geological
basin that circumscribes Lake Superior. The height of
this point is conjectural. It is probably one hundred and fifty
feet above the level of the lake.</p>

<p>To comprehend the geography of the region, it is necessary to
advert to the fact that the sandstone formation, which appears in
the picturesque form of the Pictured Rocks, is last seen in its
range eastward at La Pointe des Grande Sable, where its surface
is of a compact structure and dull red color. Between this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
locality and the bold cape of Point Iroquois, at the head of St.
Mary's River, there intervenes an extensive formation of gravel,
boulders, and sand. The length of this line of coast is about
ninety miles, its breadth to the basinic rim, perhaps thirty. It
is covered with small pines, spruce, birch, and poplar, with frequent
sphagnous tracts and ponds; the lake shore, where the
sands are continually accumulated, being higher than the interior
portions. It has, from early days, been a favorite resort for
beaver, from which it is called by the natives, Namikong, meaning,
excellent place of beavers.</p>

<p>This tract of the Namikong is primarily due to diluvial formations,
with a comparatively recent hem of lake action, consisting
of sands and pebbles pushed up by the waves of Lake Superior.
Through this tract, from the plateaux, four small rivers make
their way to the lake. They are, in their order, from west to
east, the river of Grand Mauvais, the Twin River, the Shelldrake,
and the Tacquimenon, which enters the lake fifteen miles from
Point Iroquois.</p>

<p>Of these streams, the Tacquimenon carries the largest body of
water into the lake. It is already a stream of seventy feet wide,
and three feet deep, when it reaches the rim of sandstone rocks
referred to. Over these, it is plunged, at a single perpendicular
leap, forty feet, falling like a curtain. It drops into a vast concavity
in the sand rock, where the water is of unfathomable depth,
black and still. I had reached this point in a canoe manned by
Indians. They had urged their way up a very rapid brawling
bed for six miles above the lower falls, and when we reached this
still, deep, and dark basin, they said that care was required to
keep from under the suction of the falling sheet.</p>

<p>The lower falls of the stream are probably twelve or fourteen
feet. They are broken into several fan-shaped cascades, and present
a picturesque appearance&mdash;an idea which has also impressed
the Chippewas, for they refer to it as a favorite locality of fairies.
Hence their name for it. Immediately below these falls the river
winds about, making a peninsula, which is covered with deciduous
trees and a fertile soil. The amount of water power at this
point is such as must command attention whenever the country
justifies settlement.</p>

5. <i>Suggestions respecting the Geological Epoch of the Deposit of Sandstone
Rock at St. Mary's Falls.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry R. Schoolcraft</span>.</p>

<p>Lake Superior presents to the eye the singular spectacle of a
body of pure translucent water, five hundred miles in length
from east to west, and one hundred and eighty or two hundred
miles wide. This vast mass of water is thought to have an extreme
depth&mdash;I know not on what principles&mdash;of nine hundred
feet deep. It lies at an elevation of six hundred feet above the
Atlantic ocean, at high water.</p>

<p>From this depth there has been protruded from its bottom two
species of formations, which were thus elevated by volcanic forces,
namely, the trap and the granitical series. Cones and high mural
cliffs, with large rents, make this basis one of great inequalities.
To fill up these, the sedimentary rocks, by a natural law of gravitation,
let fall the dissolved and suspended matter which constitutes
the horizontal strata, such as the neutral and deep-colored sandstones.
This process also gives origin to grauwackes and the
grauwacke slates and the argillites. But these horizontal deposits
do not all retain their horizontality. They were tilted up by other
volcanic forces, after the deposition and hardening of the sandstones,
as we see them at the north foot of the Porcupine Mountains
and along the rugged valley of the St. Louis River.</p>

<p>This secondary upheaval or series of upheavals, is conceived to
furnish proof of epochs. Strata of the same mineral constitution
and system of formation which are upheaved, are clearly of posterior
age to the horizontal. Some of these strata of the secondary,
epoch have only had their horizontality disturbed, while
others are quite vertical. Yet, the disturbances of an epoch are
only relative, and it remains true that any disturbance, however
slight, in the fundamental series, throws the epoch beyond the
newer fletz and tertiary formations.</p>

<p>Some theory of this kind is necessary in scrutinizing the position
of the St. Mary's sandstone, which is manifestly of the palaozoic
era. It has felt the impulse of disturbance, although it appears
to be little. Evidences of this are most perceptible in the
British Channel, on the north side of the Island of St. Joseph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
This channel, and, indeed, the entire course of the river up to Lake
Superior, is the line of juxtaposition between the rocks of elder
and the secondary epoch. At the extreme foot of Sugar Island
occurs the remains of a stratum of the sandstone era, consisting
of white quartz filled with coarse red jasper pebbles. I observed
remains of this stratum of remarkable rock, which have been
broken off and swept away in the basin of Lake Huron, deposited
in boulder masses on its southern shores.</p>

<p>The sandstone of St. Mary's is, structurally, brittle, fissile, and
worthless, as a building material. Its substructure is complicated
and made up of thin layers exactly deposited, as if from watery
suspension, but deposited without disturbance. These sub-layers
of construction, are sometimes cut off by parallel lines at right
angles, or by new series of layers diagonally formed, or in echelon.</p>

CONDITION AND DISPOSITION.</h4>

<p class="hanging indent">

1. <i>Official Report of an Expedition through Upper Michigan and
Northern Wisconsin in 1831.</i></p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Sault Ste. Marie</span>, Sept. 21, 1831.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In compliance with instructions to endeavor to terminate
the hostilities between the Chippewas and Sioux, I proceeded into
the Chippewa country with thirteen men in two canoes, having
the necessary provisions and presents for the Indians, an interpreter,
a physician to attend the sick, and a person in charge of
the provisions and other public property. The commanding
officer of Fort Brady furnished me with an escort of ten soldiers,
under the command of a lieutenant; and I took with me a few
Chippewas, in a canoe provided with oars, to convey a part of the
provisions. A flag was procured for each canoe. I joined the
expedition at the head of the portage, at this place, on the 25th
of June; and, after visiting the Chippewa villages in the belt of
country between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, in latitudes
44° to 46°, returned on the 4th of September, having been absent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
seventy-two days, and travelled a line of country estimated to be
two thousand three hundred and eight miles. I have now the
honor to report to you the route pursued, the means employed to
accomplish the object, and such further measures as appear to me
to be necessary to give effect to what has been done, and to insure
a lasting peace between the two tribes.</p>

<p>Reasons existed for not extending the visit to the Chippewa
bands on the extreme Upper Mississippi, on Red Lake, and Red
River, and the River De Corbeau. After entering Lake Superior,
and traversing its southern shores to Point Chegoimegon, and the
adjacent cluster of islands, I ascended the Mauvaise River to a
portage of 8-¾ miles into the Kaginogumac, or Long Water Lake.
This lake is about eight miles long, and of very irregular width.
Thence, by a portage of 280 yards, into Turtle Lake; thence, by
a portage of 1,075 yards, into Clary's Lake, so called; thence, by
a portage of 425 yards, into Lake Polyganum; and thence, by a
portage of 1,050 yards, into the Namakagon River, a branch of
the River St. Croix of the Upper Mississippi. The distance from
Lake Superior to this spot is, by estimation, 124 miles.</p>

<p>We descended the Namakagon to the Pukwaewa, a rice lake,
and a Chippewa village of eight permanent lodges, containing a
population of 53 persons, under a local chief called Odabossa. We
found here gardens of corn, potatoes, and pumpkins, in a very
neat state of cultivation. The low state of the water, and the
consequent difficulty of the navigation, induced me to leave the
provisions and stores at this place, in charge of Mr. Woolsey, with
directions to proceed (with part of the men, and the aid of the
Indians) to <i>Lac Courtorielle</i>, or Ottowa Lake, and there await my
arrival. I then descended the Namakagon in a light canoe, to its
discharge into the St. Croix, and down the latter to Yellow River,
the site of a trading-post and an Indian village, where I had, by
runners, appointed a council. In this trip I was accompanied by
Mr. Johnson, sub-agent, acting as interpreter, and by Dr. Houghton,
adjunct professor of the Rensselaer school. We reached
Yellow River on the 1st of August, and found the Indians assembled.
After terminating the business of the council (of which I
shall presently mention the results), I reascended the St. Croix
and the Namakagon, to the portage which intervenes between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
latter and Lac Courtorielle. The first of the series of carrying-places
is about three miles in length, and terminates at the Lake
of the Isles (<i>Lac des Isles</i>); after crossing which, a portage of 750
yards leads to <i>Lac du Gres</i>. This lake has a navigable outlet into
Ottowa Lake, where I rejoined the advanced party (including
Lieutenant Clary's detachment) on the 5th of August.</p>

<p>Ottowa Lake is a considerable expanse of water, being about
twelve miles long, with irregular but elevated shores. A populous
Chippewa village and a trading-post are located at its outlet,
and a numerous Indian population subsists in the vicinity. It is
situated in a district of country which abounds in rice lakes, has
a proportion of prairie or burnt land, caused by the ravages of
fire, and, in addition to the small fur-bearing animals, has several
of the deer species. It occupies, geographically, a central situation,
being intermediate, and commanding the communications
between the St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers, and between Lake
Superior and the Upper Mississippi. It is on the great slope of
land descending towards the latter, enjoys a climate of comparative
mildness, and yields, with few and short intervals of extreme
want, the means of subsistence to a population which is
still essentially erratic. These remarks apply, with some modifications,
to the entire range of country (within the latitudes mentioned)
situated west and south of the high lands circumscribing
the waters of Lake Superior. The outlet of this Lake (Ottowa)
is a fork of Chippewa River, called Ottowa River.</p>

<p>I had intended to proceed from this lake, either by following
down the Ottowa branch to its junction with the main Chippewa,
and then ascending the latter into Lac du Flambeau, or by descending
the Ottowa branch only to its junction with the northwest
fork, called the Ochasowa River; and, ascending the latter
to a portage of sixty <i>pauses</i>, into the Chippewa River. By the
latter route time and distance would have been saved, and I
should, in either way, have been enabled to proceed from Lac du
Flambeau to Green Bay by an easy communication into the Upper
Ouisconsin, and from the latter into the Menomonie River, or by
Plover Portage into Wolf River. This was the route I had designed
to go on quitting Lake Superior; but, on consulting my
Indian maps, and obtaining at Ottowa Lake the best and most
recent information of the distance and the actual state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
water, I found neither of the foregoing routes practicable, without
extending my time so far as to exhaust my supplies. I was finally
determined to relinquish the Lac du Flambeau route, by learning
that the Indians of that place had dispersed, and by knowing that
a considerable delay would be caused by reassembling them.</p>

<p>The homeward route by the Mississippi was now the most eligible,
particularly as it would carry me through a portion of
country occupied by the Chippewas, in a state of hostility with
the Sioux, and across the disputed line at the mill. Two routes,
to arrive at the Mississippi, were before me&mdash;either to follow
down the outlet of Ottowa Lake to its junction with the Chippewa,
and descend the latter to its mouth, or to quit the Ottowa
Lake branch at an intermediate point, and, after ascending a small
and very serpentine tributary, to cross a portage of 6,000 yards
into Lake Chetac. I pursued the latter route.</p>

<p>Lake Chetac is a sheet of water about six miles in length, and
it has several islands, on one of which is a small Chippewa village
and a trading-post. This lake is the main source of Red Cedar
River (called sometimes the <i>Folle Avoine</i>), a branch of the Chippewa
River. It receives a brook at its head from the direction
of the portage, which admits empty canoes to be conveyed down
it two <i>pauses</i>, but is then obstructed with logs. It is connected
by a shallow outlet with Weegwos Lake, a small expanse which
we crossed with paddles in twenty-five minutes. The passage
from the latter is so shallow that a portage of 1,295 yards is made
into Balsam of Fir or <i>Sapin</i> Lake. The baggage is carried this
distance, but the canoes are brought through the stream. Sapin
Lake is also small; we were thirty minutes in crossing it. Below
this point, the river again expands into a beautiful sheet of water,
called Red Cedar Lake, which we were an hour in passing; and
afterward into <i>Bois François</i>, or Rice Lake. At the latter place,
at the distance of perhaps sixty miles from its head, I found the
last fixed village of Chippewas on this stream, although the hunting
camps, and other signs of temporary occupation, were more
numerous below than on any other part of the stream. This may
be attributed to the abundance of the Virginia deer in that vicinity,
many of which we saw, and of the elk and moose, whose
tracks were fresh and numerous in the sands of the shore. Wild
rice is found in all the lakes. Game, of every species common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
to the latitude, is plentiful. The prairie country extends itself
into the vicinity of Rice Lake; and for more than a day's march
before reaching the mouth of the river, the whole face of the
country puts on a sylvan character, as beautiful to the eye as it
is fertile in soil, and spontaneously productive of the means of
subsistence. A country more valuable to a population having
the habits of our northwestern Indians could hardly be conceived
of; and it is therefore cause of less surprise that its possession
should have been so long an object of contention between the
Chippewas and Sioux.</p>

<p>About sixty miles below Rice Lake commences a series of
rapids, which extend, with short intervals, 24 miles. The remainder
of the distance, to the junction of this stream with the
Chippewa, consists of deep and strong water. The junction itself
is characterized by commanding and elevated grounds, and a
noble expanse of waters. And the Chippewa River, from this
spot to its entrance into the Mississippi, has a depth and volume,
and a prominence of scenery, which mark it to be inferior to
none, and superior to most of the larger tributaries of the Upper
Mississippi. Before its junction, it is separated into several
mouths, from the principal of which the observer can look into
Lake Pepin. Steamboats could probably ascend to the falls.</p>

<p>The whole distance travelled, from the shores of Lake Superior
to the mouth of the Chippewa, is, by estimation, 643 miles, of
which 138 should be deducted for the trip to Yellow River leaving
the direct practicable route 505 miles. The length of the
Mauvaise to the portage is 104; of the Namakagon, from the
portage, 161; of the Red Cedar, 170; of the Chippewa, from the
entrance of the latter, 40. Our means of estimating distances
was by time, corrected by reference to the rapidity of water and
strength of wind, compared with our known velocity of travelling
in calm weather on the lakes. These estimates were made and
put down every evening, and considerable confidence is felt in
them. The courses were accurately kept by a canoe compass.
I illustrate my report of this part of the route by a map protracted
by Dr. Houghton. On this map, our places of encampment,
the sites and population of the principal Indian villages,
the trading-posts, and the boundary lines between the Sioux and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
Chippewa, are indicated. And I refer you to it for several details
which are omitted in this report.</p>

<p>The present state of the controversy between the Sioux and
the Chippewas will be best inferred from the facts that follow.
In stating them, I have deemed it essential to preserve the order
of my conferences with the Indians, and to confine myself, almost
wholly, to results.</p>

<p>Along the borders of Lake Superior, comparatively little alarm
was felt from the hostile relation with the Sioux. But I found
them well informed of the state of the difficulties, and the result
of the several war-parties that had been sent out the last year.
A system of information and advice is constantly kept up by runners;
and there is no movement meditated on the Sioux borders,
which is not known and canvassed by the lake bands.</p>

<p>They sent warriors to the scene of conflict last year, in consequence
of the murder committed by the Sioux on the St. Croix.
Their sufferings from hunger during the winter, and the existence
of disease at Torch Lake (<i>Lac du Flambeau</i>), and some other
places, together with the entire failure of the rice crop, had produced
effects, which were depicted by them and by the traders in
striking colors. They made these sufferings the basis of frequent
and urgent requests for provisions. This theme was strenuously
dwelt upon. Whatever other gifts they asked for, they never
omitted the gift of food. They made it their first, their second,
and their third request.</p>

<p>At Chegoimegon, on Lake Superior (or <i>La Pointe</i>, emphatically
so called), I held my first and stated council with the Indians.
This is the ancient seat of the Chippewa power in this
quarter. It is a central and commanding point, with respect to
the country lying north, and west, and south of it. It appears
to be the focus from which, as radii from a centre, the ancient
population emigrated; and the interior bands consequently look
back to it with something of the feelings of parental relation.
News from the frontiers flies back to it with a celerity which is
peculiar to the Indian mode of express. I found here, as I had
expected, the fullest and most recent information from the lines.
Mozojeed, the principal man at Ottowa Lake, had recently visited
them for the purpose of consultation; but returned on the alarm
of an attack upon his village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
The Indians listened with attention to the message transmitted
to them from the President, and to the statements with which it
was enforced. Pezhickee, the venerable and respected chief of
the place, was their speaker in reply. He lamented the war, and
admitted the folly of keeping it up; but it was carried on by the
Chippewas in self-defence, and by volunteer parties of young
men, acting without the sanction of the old chiefs. He thought
the same remark due to the elder Sioux chiefs, who probably did
not sanction the crossing of the lines, but could not restrain their
young men. He lived, he said, in an isolated situation, did not
mingle in the interior broils, and did not deem himself responsible
for acts done out of his own village, and certainly not for the acts
of the villages of Torch Lake, Ottowa Lake, and the St. Croix.
He had uniformly advised his people to sit still and remain at
peace, and he believed that none of his young men had joined
the war-parties of last year. The Government, he said, should
have his hearty co-operation in restoring peace. He referred to
the sub-agency established here in 1826, spoke of its benefits, and
wished to know why the agent had been withdrawn, and whether
he would be instructed to return? In the course of his reply, he
said that formerly, when the Indians lived under the British government,
they were usually told what to do, and in very distinct
terms; but they were now at a loss. From what had been said and
done at the treaty of Fond du Lac, he expected the care and protection
of the American government, and that they would advance
towards, instead of (as in the case of the sub-agency) withdrawing
from them. He was rather at a loss for our views respecting the
Chippewas, and he wished much for my advice in their affairs.</p>

<p>I thought it requisite to make a distinct reply to this point. I
told him that when they lived under the British government,
they were justified in shaping their course according to the advice
they received; but that, on the transfer of the country, their allegiance
was transferred with it. And when our Government
hoisted its flag at Mackinac (1796), it expected from the Indians
living within our boundaries the respect due to it; and it acknowledged,
at the same time, the reciprocal obligations of care and
protection. That it always aimed to fulfil these obligations, of
which facts within his own knowledge and memory would afford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>ample proofs. I referred him to the several efforts the Government
had made to establish a lasting peace between the Chippewas
and Sioux; for which purpose the President had sent one of
his principal men (alluding to Gov. Cass), in 1820, who had visited
their most extreme northwestern villages, and induced themselves
and the Sioux to smoke the pipe of peace together at St. Peter's.
In accordance with these views, and acting on the information
then acquired, the President had established an agency for their
tribe at Sault Ste. Marie, in 1822. That, in 1825, he had assembled
at Prairie du Chien all the tribes who were at variance on
the Upper Mississippi, and persuaded them to make peace, and,
as one of the best means of insuring its permanency, had fixed
the boundaries of their lands. Seeing that the Chippewas and
Sioux still continued an harassing and useless contest, he had sent
me to remind them of this peace and these boundaries, which, I
added, you, Perikee, yourself agreed to, and signed, in my presence.
I come to bring you back to the terms of this treaty. Are
not these proofs of his care and attention? Are not these clear
indications of his, views respecting the Chippewas? The chief
was evidently affected by this recital. The truth appeared to
strike him forcibly; and he said, in a short reply, that he was
now <i>advised</i>; that he would hereafter feel himself to be advised,
&amp;c. He made some remarks on the establishment of a mission
school, &amp;c., which, being irrelevant, are omitted. He presented
a pipe, with an ornamented stem, as a token of his friendship, and
his desire of peace.</p>

<p>I requested him to furnish messengers to take belts of wampum
and tobacco, with three separate messages, viz: to Yellow River,
to Ottowa Lake, and to Lac du Flambeau, or Torch Lake; and
also, as the water was low, to aid me in the ascent of the Mauvaise
River, and to supply guides for each of the military canoes,
as the soldiers would here leave their barge, and were unacquainted
with the difficulties of the ascent. He accordingly sent
his oldest son (Che-che-gwy-ung) and another person, with the
messages, by a direct trail, leading into the St. Croix country.
He also furnished several young Chippewas to aid us on the Mauvaise,
and to carry baggage on the long portage into the first
intermediate lake west of that stream.</p>

<p>After the distribution of presents, I left Chegoimegon on the
18th of July. The first party of Indians met at the Namakagon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
belonging to a Chippewa village called Pukwaewa; having, as its
geographical centre and trading-post, Ottowa Lake. As I had
directed part of the expedition to precede me there, during my
journey to Yellow River, I requested these Indians to meet me
at Ottowa Lake, and assist in conveying the stores and provisions
to that place&mdash;a service which they cheerfully performed. On
ascending the lower part of the Namakagon, I learned that my
messenger from Lake Superior had passed, and, on reaching Yellow
River, I found the Indians assembled and waiting. They
were encamped on an elevated ridge, called Pekogunagun, or the
Hip Bone, and fired a salute from its summit. Several of the
neighboring Indians came in after my arrival. Others, with their
chiefs, were hourly expected. I did not deem it necessary for all
to come in, but proceeded to lay before them the objects of my
visit, and to solicit their co-operation in an attempt to make a
permanent peace with the Sioux, whose borders we then were
near. Kabamappa, the principal chief, not being a speaker, responded
to my statements and recommendations through another
person (Sha-ne-wa-gwun-ai-be). He said that the Sioux were of
bad faith; that they never refused to smoke the pipe of peace
with them, and they never failed to violate the promise of peace
thus solemnly made. He referred to an attack they made last
year on a band of Chippewas and half-breeds, and the murder of
four persons. Perpetual vigilance was required to meet these
inroads. Yet he could assert, fearlessly, that no Chippewa war-party
from the St. Croix had crossed the Sioux line for years;
that the murder he had mentioned was committed within the
Chippewa lines; and although it was said, at the treaty of Prairie
du Chien, that the first aggressor of territorial rights should be
punished, neither punishment was inflicted by the Government,
nor had any atonement or apology thus far been made for this
act by the Sioux. He said his influence had been exerted in
favor of peace; that he had uniformly advised both chiefs and
warriors to this effect; and he stood ready now to do whatever it
was reasonable he should do on the subject.</p>

<p>I told him it was not a question of recrimination that was before
us. It was not even necessary to go into the inquiry of who
had spilt the first blood since the treaty of Prairie du Chien. The
treaty had been violated. The lines had been crossed. Murders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
had been committed by the Chippewas and by the Sioux. These
murders had reached the ears of the President, and he was resolved
to put a stop to them. I did not doubt but that the advice
of the old chiefs, on each side, had been pacific. I did not doubt
but that his course had been <i>particularly</i> so. But rash young
men, of each party, had raised the war-club; and when they could
not go openly, they went secretly. A stop must be put to this
course, and it was necessary the first movement should be made
<i>somewhere</i>. It was proper it should be made here, and be made
at this time. Nothing could be lost by it; much might be gained;
and if a negotiation was opened with the Sioux chiefs while I
remained, I would second it by sending an explanatory message
to the chiefs and to their agent. I recommended that Kabamappa
and Shakoba, the war-chief of Snake River, should send jointly
wampum and tobacco to the Petite Corbeau and to Wabisha, the
leading Sioux chiefs on the Mississippi, inviting them to renew
the league of friendship, and protesting their own sincerity in the
offer. I concluded by presenting him with a flag, tobacco, wampum,
and ribbons, to be used in the negotiation. After a consultation,
he said he would not only send the messages, but, as he
now had the protection of a flag, he would himself go with the
chief Shakoba to the Petite Corbeau's village. I accompanied
these renewed offers of peace with explanatory messages, in my
own name, to Petite Corbeau and to Wabisha, and a letter to Mr.
Taliaferro, the Indian agent at St. Peter's, informing him of these
steps, and soliciting his co-operation. A copy of this letter is
hereunto annexed. I closed the council by the distribution of
presents; after which the Indians called my attention to the conduct
of their trader, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Information was given me immediately after my arrival at Yellow
River, that Neenaba, a popular war-leader from the Red
Cedar fork of Chippewa River, had very recently danced the war-dance
with thirty men at Rice Lake of Yellow River, and that
his object was to enlist the young men of that place in a war-party
against the Sioux. I also learned that my message for
Ottowa Lake had been promptly transmitted through Neenaba,
whom I was now anxious to see. I lost not an hour in reascending
the St. Croix and the Namakagon. I purchased two additional
canoes of the Indians, and distributed my men in them, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
lighten the draught of water, and facilitate the ascent; and, by
pushing early and late, we reached Ottowa Lake on the fifth day
in the morning. Neenaba had, however, delivered his message,
and departed. I was received in a very friendly and welcome
manner, by Mozojeed, of the band of Ottowa Lake; Wabezhais,
of the Red Devil's band of the South Pukwaewa; and Odabossa,
of the Upper Namakagon. After passing the usual formalities, I
prepared to meet them in council the same day, and communicate
to them the objects of my mission.</p>

<p>In the course of the conference at this place, I obtained the particulars
of a dispute which had arisen between the Chippewas of
this quarter, which now added to their alarm, as they feared the
latter would act in coincidence with their ancient enemies, the
Sioux. The reports of this disturbance had reached me at the
Sault, and they continued, with some variations, until my arrival
here. The following are the material facts in relation to this new
cause of disquietude: In the summer of 1827, Okunzhewug, an
old woman, the wife of Kishkemun, the principal chief of Torch
Lake, a man superannuated and blind, attended the treaty of Butte
des Morts, bearing her husband's medal. She was treated with
the respect due to the character she represented, and ample presents
were directed to be given to her; among other things, a
handsome hat. The latter article had been requested of her by
a young Menomonie, and refused. It is thought a general feeling
of jealousy was excited by her good reception. A number of the
Menomonies went on her return route as far as the Clover Portage,
where she was last seen. Having never returned to her village,
the Chippewas attributed her death to the Menomonies. Her
husband died soon after; but she had numerous and influential
relatives to avenge her real or supposed murder. This is the
account delivered by the Chippewas, and it is corroborated by
reports from the traders of that section of the country. Her singular
disappearance and secret death at the Clover Portage, is
undisputed; and whether caused or not by any agency of the
Menomonies, the belief of such agency, and that of the most direct
kind, is fixed in the minds of the Chippewas, and has furnished
the basis of their subsequent acts in relation to the Menomonie
hunting-parties who have visited the lower part of Chippewa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
River. Two women belonging to one of these parties were killed
by a Chippewa war-party traversing that part of the country the
ensuing year. The act was disclaimed by them as not being intentional,
and it was declared they supposed the women to be
Sioux. On a close inquiry, however, I found the persons who
committed this act were relatives of Okunzewug, which renders it
probable that the murder was intentionally perpetrated. This act
further widened the breach between the two hitherto fraternal
tribes; and the Chippewas of this quarter began to regard the
Menomonie hunting-parties, who entered the mouth of the Chippewa
River, as intruders on their lands. Among a people whose
means of verbal information is speedy, and whose natural sense
of right and wrong is acute, the more than usual friendship and
apparent alliance which have taken place between the Menomonies
and Sioux, in the contest between the Sacs and Foxes, and
the murder by them jointly of the Fox chief White Skin and his
companions at a smoking council, in 1830, have operated to increase
the feeling of distrust; so much so, that it was openly reported
at Chegoimegon, at Yellow River, and Ottowa Lake, that
the Menomonies had formed a league with the Sioux against the
Chippewas also, and they were fearful of an attack from them.
A circumstance that had given point to this fear, and made it a
subject of absorbing interest, when I arrived at Ottowa Lake, was
the recent murder of a Menomonie chief by a Chippewa of that
quarter, and the demand of satisfaction which had been made (it
was sometimes said) by the Indian agent at Prairie du Chien, and
sometimes by the commanding officer, with a threat to march
troops into the country. This demand, I afterward learned from
the Indians at Rice Lake, and from a conversation with General
Street, the agent at Prairie du Chien, had not been made, either
by himself or by the commanding officer; and the report had probably
arisen from a conversation held by a subaltern officer in
command of a wood or timber-party near the mouth of the Chippewa
River, with some Chippewas who were casually met. Its
effects, however, were to alarm them, and to lead them to desire
a reconciliation with the Menomonies. I requested them to lose
no time in sending tobacco to the Menomonies, and adjusting this
difference. Mozojeed observed that the murder of the Menomonie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
had been committed by a person <i>non compos</i>, and he deplored the
folly of it, and disclaimed all agency in it for himself and his
band. The murderer, I believe, belonged to his band; he desired
a reconciliation. He also said the measures adopted at Yellow
River, to bring about a firm peace with the Sioux, had his fullest
approbation, and that nothing on his part should be wanting to
promote a result in every view so wise and so advantageous to
the Indians. In this sentiment, Wabezhais and Odabossa, who
made distinct speeches, also concurred. They confirmed their
words by pipes, and all the assembly made an audible assent. I
invested Mozojeed with a flag and a medal, that he might exert
the influence he has acquired among the Indians beneficially for
them and for us, and that his hands might thus be officially
strengthened to accomplish the work of pacification. I then distributed
presents to the chiefs, warriors, women, and children, in
the order of their being seated, and immediately embarked, leaving
them under a lively and enlivened sense of the good-will and
friendship of the American government, on this first official visit
to them, and with a sincere disposition, so far as could be judged,
to act in obedience to its expressed and known wishes.</p>

<p>The Indians at Torch Lake being dispersed, and my message
to them not having been delivered, from this uncertainty of their
location, I should have found reasons for not proceeding in that
direction, independent of the actual and known difficulties of the
route at that time. I was still apprehensive that my appearance
had not wholly disconcerted the war-party of Neenaba, and lost
no time in proceeding to his village on the Red Cedar fork. We
found the village at Lake Chetac, which in 1824 was 217 strong,
almost totally deserted, and the trading-house burnt. Scattering
Indians were found along the river. The mutual fear of interruption
was such that Mr. B. Cadotte, Sen., the trader at Ottowa
Lake, thought it advisable to follow in our train for the purpose
of collecting his credits at Rice Lake.</p>

<p>While at breakfast on the banks of Sapin Lake, a returning
war-party entered the opposite side of it; they were evidently surprised,
and they stopped. After reconnoitring us, they were encouraged
to advance, at first warily, and afterward with confidence.
There were eight canoes, with two men in each; each man had a
gun, war-club, knife, and ammunition-bag: there was nothing else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
except the apparatus for managing the canoe. They were all
young men, and belonged to the vicinity of Ottowa Lake. Their
unexpected appearance at this place gave me the first information
that the war-party at Neenaba had been broken up. They reported
that some of their number had been near the mill, and that
they had discovered signs of the Sioux being out, in the moose
having been driven up, &amp;c. In a short conference, I recited to
them the purpose of the council at Ottowa Lake, and referred
them to their chiefs for particulars, enjoining their acquiescence
in the proposed measures.</p>

<p>I found at Rice Lake a band of Chippewas, most of them young
men, having a prompt and martial air, encamped in a very compact
form, and prepared at a moment's notice, for action. They
saluted our advance with a smartness and precision of firing that
would have done honor to drilled troops. Neenaba was absent
on a hunting-party; but one of the elder men pointed out a suitable
place for my encampment, as I intended here to put new bottoms
to my bark canoes. He arrived in the evening, and visited
my camp with forty-two men. This visit was one of ceremony
merely; as it was late, I deferred anything further until the following
day. I remained at this place part of the 7th, the 8th,
and until 3 o'clock on the 9th of August. And the following facts
present the result of several conferences with this distinguished
young man, whose influence is entirely of his own creation, and
whose endowments, personal and mental, had not been misrepresented
by the Indians on my route, who uniformly spoke of him
in favorable terms. He is located at the most advanced point
towards the Sioux borders, and, although not in the line of ancient
chiefs, upon him rests essentially the conduct of affairs in this
quarter. I therefore deemed it important to acquire his confidence
and secure his influence, and held frequent conversations
with him. His manner was frank and bold, equally free from
servility and repulsiveness. I drew his attention to several subjects.
I asked him whether the saw-mill on the lower part of the
Red Cedar, was located on Chippewa lands? He said, Yes.
Whether it was built with the consent of the Chippewas? He
said, No; it had been built, as it were, by stealth. I asked him
if anything had been subsequently given them in acknowledgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>of their right to the soil? He said, No; that the only acknowledgment
was their getting tobacco to smoke when they
visited the mill; that the Sioux claimed it to be on their side of
the line, but the Chippewas contended that their line ran to a certain
bluff and brook below the mill. I asked him to draw a map
of the lower part of Chippewa River, with all its branches, showing
the exact lines as fixed by the treaty at Prairie du Chien, and
as understood by them. I requested him to state the facts respecting
the murder of the Menomonie, and the causes that led to
it; and whether he, or any of his band, received any message
from the agent or commanding officer at Prairie du Chien, demanding
the surrender of the murderer? To the latter inquiry
he answered promptly, No. He gave in his actual population at
142; but it is evident that a very considerable additional population,
particularly men, resort there for the purpose of hunting a
part of the year.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival, I prepared for and summoned the
Indians to a council, with the usual formalities. I opened it by
announcing the objects of my visit. Neenaba and his followers
listened to the terms of the message, the means I had adopted to
enforce it, and, finally, to the request of co-operation on the part
of himself and band, with strict attention. He confined his reply
to an expression of thanks, allusions to the peculiarity of his
situation on an exposed frontier, and general, sentiments of
friendship. He appeared to be mentally embarrassed by my
request to drop the war-club, on the successful use of which he
had relied for his popularity, and whatever of real power he possessed.
He often referred to his young men, over whom he
claimed no superiority, and who appeared to be ardently attached
to him. I urged the principal topic upon his attention, presenting
it in several lights. I finally conferred on him, personally,
a medal and flag, and directed the presents intended for his band
to be laid, in gross, before him.</p>

<p>After a pause, Neenaba got up, and spoke to the question, connecting
it with obvious considerations, of which mutual rights,
personal safety, and the obligation to protect the women and
children, formed the basis. The latter duty was not a slight one.
Last year, the Sioux had killed a chief on the opposite shore of
the lake, and, at the same time, decoyed two children, who were
in a canoe, among the rice, and killed and beheaded them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
said, in allusion to the medal and flag, that these marks of honor
were not necessary to secure his attention to any requests made
by the American government. And after resuming his seat
awhile (during which he overheard some remarks not pleasing to
him, from an Indian on the opposite side of the ring), he finally
got up and declined receiving them until they were eventually
pressed upon him by the young warriors. Everything appeared
to proceed with great harmony, and the presents were quickly
distributed by one of his men. It was not, however, until the
next day, when my canoes were already put in the water, that he
came with his entire party, to make his final reply, and to present
the peace-pipe. He had thrown the flag over one arm, and held
the war-club perpendicularly in the other hand. He said that,
although he accepted the one, he did not drop the other; he held
fast to both. When he looked at the one, he should revert to the
counsels with which it had been given, and he should aim to act
upon those counsels; but he also deemed it necessary to hold fast
the war-club; it was, however, with a determination to use it in
defence, and not in attack. He had reflected upon the advice sent
to the Chippewas by the President, and particularly that part of
it which counselled them to sit still upon their lands; but while
they sat still, they also wished to be certain that their enemies
would sit still. And the pipe he was now about to offer, he
offered with a request that it might be sent to the President, asking
him to use his power to prevent the Sioux from crossing the
lines. The pipe was then lit, handed round, the ashes knocked
out, and a formal presentation of it made. This ceremony being
ended, I shook hands with them, and immediately embarked.</p>

<p>On the second day afterward, I reached the saw-mill, the subject
of such frequent allusion, and landed there at 7 o'clock in the
morning. I found a Mr. Wallace in charge, who was employed,
with ten men, in building a new dam on a brook of the Red
Cedar, the freshet of last spring having carried away the former
one. I inquired of him where the line between the Sioux and
Chippewas crossed. He replied that the line crossed above the
mill, he did not precisely know the place; adding, however, in
the course of conversation, that he believed the land in this vicinity
originally belonged to the Chippewas. He said it was seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
years since any Sioux had visited the mill; and that the latter
was owned by persons at Prairie du Chien.</p>

<p>The rapids of the Red Cedar River extend (according to the
estimates contained in my notes) about twenty-four miles. They
commence a few miles below the junction of Meadow River, and
terminate about two miles below the mills. This extension of
falling water, referred to in the treaty as a fixed point, has led
to the existing uncertainty. The country itself is of a highly
valuable character for its soil, its game, its wild rice, and its wood.
We found the butternut among those species which are locally
included under the name of <i>Bois franc</i>, by the traders. The land
can, hereafter, be easily brought into cultivation, as it is interspersed
with prairie; and its fine mill privileges will add to its
value. Indeed, one mile square is intrinsically worth one hundred
miles square of Chippewa country, in some other places.</p>

<p>The present saw-mills (there are two), are situated 65 miles
from the banks of the Mississippi. They are owned exclusively
by private citizens, and employed for their sole benefit. The
boards are formed into rafts; and these rafts are afterward attached
together, and floated down the Mississippi to St. Louis,
where they command a good price. The business is understood
to be a profitable one. For the privilege, no equivalent has been
paid either to the Indians or to the United States. The first mill
was built several years ago, and before the conclusion of the
treaty of Prairie du Chien, fixing boundaries to the lands. A
permit was given for building, either verbal or written, as I have
been informed, by a former commanding officer at Prairie du
Chien. I make these statements in reference to a letter I have
received from the Department since my return, but which is
dated June 27th, containing a complaint of one of the owners of
the mill, that the Chippewas had threatened to burn it, and requesting
me to take the necessary precautionary measures. I
heard nothing of such a threat, but believe that the respect which
the Chippewas have professed, through me, for the American
government, and the influence of my visit among them, will prevent
a resort to any measures of violence; and that they will wait
the peaceable adjustment of the line on the rapids. I will add
that, <i>wherever</i> that line may be determined, in a reasonable probability,
to fall, the mill itself cannot be supplied with logs for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
any length of time, if <i>it is now so supplied</i>, without cutting them on
Chippewa lands, and rafting them down the Red Cedar. Many
of the logs heretofore sawed at this mill, have been rafted <i>up
stream</i>, to the mill. And I understood from the person in charge
of it, that he was now anxious to ascertain new sites for chopping;
that his expectations were directed up the stream, but that his
actual knowledge of the country, in that direction, did not embrace
a circumference of more than five miles.</p>

<p>The line between the Chippewa and Sioux, as drawn on the
MS. map of Neenaba, strikes the rapids on Red Cedar River at
a brook and bluff a short distance below the mill. It proceeds
thence, across the point of land between that branch of the main
Chippewa, to an island in the latter; and thence, up stream, to
the mouth of Clearwater River, as called for by the treaty, and
from this point to the bluffs of the Mississippi Valley (where it
corners on Winnebago land), on Black River, and not to the
"<i>mouth</i>" of Black River, as erroneously inserted in the 5th article
of the treaty; the Chippewas never having advanced any
claims to the lands at the mouth of Black River. This map, being
drawn by a Chippewa of sense, influence, and respectability,
an exact copy of it is herewith forwarded for the use of the
Department, as embracing the opinions of the Chippewas on this
point. The lines and geographical marks were drawn on paper
by Neenaba himself, and the names translated and written down
by Mr. Johnston.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the adjustment of this line must precede a
permanent peace on this part of the frontiers. The number of
Chippewas particularly interested in it is, from my notes, 2,102;
to which, 911 may be added for certain bands on Lake Superior.
It embraces 27 villages, and the most influential civil and war
chiefs of the region. The population is enterprising and warlike.
They have the means of subsistence in <i>comparative</i> abundance.
They are increasing in numbers. They command a ready access
to the Mississippi by water, and a ready return from it by land.
Habits of association have taught them to look upon this stream
as the theatre of war. Their young men are carried into it as
the natural and almost only means of distinction. And it is in
coincidence with all observation to say that they are now, as they
were in the days of Captain Carver, the terror of the east bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
of this river, between the St. Croix and Chippewa Rivers. No
other tribe has now, or has had, within the memory of man, a
village or permanent possession on this part of the shore. It is
landed on in fear. It is often passed by other nations by stealth,
and at night. Such is not an exaggerated picture. And with a
knowledge of their geographical advantages, and numbers, and
distribution, on the tributary streams, slight causes, it may be
imagined, will often excite the young and thoughtless portion of
them to raise the war-club, to chant the war-song, and follow the
war-path.</p>

<p>To remove these causes, to teach them the folly of such a
contest, to remind them of the treaty stipulations and promises
solemnly made to the Government, and to the Sioux, and to induce
them to renew those promises, and to act on fixed principles of
political faith, were the primary objects committed to me; and
they were certainly objects of exalted attainment, according as
well with the character of the Government as with the spirit and
moral and intellectual tone of the age. To these objects I have
faithfully, as I believe, devoted the means at my command. And
the Chippewas cannot, hereafter, err on the subject of their hostilities
with the Sioux, without knowing that the error is disapproved
by the American government, and that a continuance in
it will be visited upon them in measures of severity.</p>

<p>Without indulging the expectation that my influence on the
tour will have the effect to put an end to the spirit of predatory
warfare, it may be asserted that this spirit has been checked and
allayed; and that a state of feeling and reflection has been produced
by it, which cannot fail to be beneficial to our relations
with them, and to their relations with each other. The messages
sent to the Sioux chiefs, may be anticipated to have resulted in
restoring a perfect peace during the present fall and ensuing winter,
and will thus leave to each party the undisturbed chase of
their lands. The meditated blow of Steenaba was turned aside,
and his war-party arrested and dispersed at the moment it was
ready to proceed. Every argument was used to show them the
folly and the insecurity of a continuance of the war. And the
whole tenor and effect of my visit has been to inform and reform
these remote bands. It has destroyed the charm of their seclusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>It has taught them that their conduct is under the super-vision
of the American government; that they depend on its care
and protection; that no other government has power to regulate
trade and send traders among them; finally, that an adherence to
foreign counsels, and to anti-pacific maxims, can be visited upon
them in measures of coercion. That their country, hitherto
deemed nearly inaccessible, can be penetrated and traversed by
men and troops, with baggage and provisions, even in midsummer,
when the waters are lowest; and that, in proportion as they
comply with political maxims, as benevolent as they are just, will
they live at peace with their enemies, and have the means of subsistence
for an increased population among themselves. The
conduct of the traders in this quarter, and the influence they have
exerted, both moral and political, cannot here be entered upon,
and must be left to some other occasion, together with statistical
details and other branches of information not arising from particular
instructions.</p>

<p>It may be said that the Indians upon the St. Croix and Chippewa
Rivers, and their numerous branches, have been drawn into
a close intercourse with Government. But it will be obvious that
a perseverance in the system of official advice and restraints, is
essential to give permanence to the effects already produced, and
to secure a firm and lasting peace between them and the Sioux.
To this end, the settlement of the line upon the Red Cedar Fork is
an object which claims the attention of the Department; and
would justify, in my opinion, the calling together the parties
interested, at some convenient spot near the junction of the Red
Cedar River with the Chippewa. Indeed, the handsome elevation,
and the commanding geographical advantages of this spot,
render it one which, I think, might be advantageously occupied
as a military post. Such an occupancy would have the effect to
keep the parties at peace; and the point of land, on which the
work is proposed to be erected, might be purchased from the
Sioux, together with such part of the disputed lands near the
mills as might be deemed necessary to quiet the title of the Chippewas.
By acquiring this portion of country for the purposes of
military occupancy, the United States would be justified in punishing
any murders committed upon it; and I am fully convinced
that no measure which could, at this time, be adopted, would so
certainly conduce to a permanent peace between the tribes. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
therefore beg leave, through you, to submit these subjects to the
consideration of the honorable the Secretary of War, with every
distrust in my own powers of observation, and with a very full
confidence in his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Elbert Herring, Esq.</span>, <i>Com.  Ind. Affairs.</i></p>

<p class="section"><i>Brief Notes of a Tour in 1831, from Galena, in Illinois, to Fort
Winnebago, on the source of Fox River, Wisconsin.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry
R. Schoolcraft</span>.</p>

<p>Time admonishes me of my promise to furnish you some
account of my journey from Galena to Fort Winnebago. But I
confess, that time has taken away none of those features which
make me regard it as a task. Other objects have occupied so
much of my thoughts, that the subject has lost some of its vividness,
and I shall be obliged to confine myself more exclusively
to my notes than I had intended. This will be particularly true
in speaking of geological facts. Geographical features impress
themselves strongly on the mind. The shape of a mountain is
not easily forgotten, and its relation to contiguous waters and
woods is recollected after the lapse of many years. The succession
of plains, streams, and settlements is likewise retained in the
memory, while the peculiar plains, the soils overlaying them, and
all the variety of their mineral and organic contents, require to
be perpetuated by specimens and by notes, which impose neither
a slight nor a momentary labor.</p>

<p>Limited sketches of this kind are, furthermore, liable to be misconceived.
Prominent external objects can only be brought to
mind, and these often reveal but an imperfect notion of the pervading
character of strata, and still less knowledge of their mineral
contents. Haste takes away many opportunities of observation;
and scanty or inconvenient means of transporting hand
specimens, often deprive us of the requisite data. Indeed, I
should be loath to describe the few facts I am about to communicate,
had you not personally visited and examined the great
carboniferous and sandstone formation on the Mississippi and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
Wisconsin, and thus got the knowledge of their features. The
parallelism which is apparent in these rocks, by the pinnacles
which have been left standing on high&mdash;the wasting effects of
time in scooping out valleys and filling up declivities&mdash;and the
dark and castle-looking character of the cherty limestone bluffs,
as viewed from the water, while the shadows of evening are deepening
around, are suited to make vivid impressions. And these
broken and denuded cliffs offer the most favorable points for
making geological observations. There are no places inland
where the streams have cut so deep. On gaining the height of
land, the strata are found to be covered with so heavy a deposit
of soil, that it is difficult to glean much that can be relied on respecting
the interior structure.</p>

<p>The angle formed by the junction of the Wisconsin with the
Mississippi, is a sombre line of weather-beaten rocks. Gliding
along the current, at the base of these rocks, the idea of a "hill
country," of no very productive character, is naturally impressed
upon the observer. And this impression came down, probably,
from the days of Marquette, who was the first European, that we
read of, who descended the Wisconsin, and thus became the true
discoverer of the Mississippi. The fact that it yielded lead ore,
bits of which were occasionally brought in by the natives, was in
accordance with this opinion; and aided, it may be supposed, in
keeping out of view the real character of the country. I know
not how else to account for the light which has suddenly burst
upon us from this bank of the Mississippi, and which has at once
proved it to be as valuable for the purposes of agriculture as for
those of mining, and as sylvan in its appearance as if it were not
fringed, as it were, with rocks, and lying at a great elevation
above the water. This elevation is so considerable as to permit
a lively descent in the streams, forming numerous mill-seats.
The surface of the country is not, however, broken, but may be
compared to the heavy and lazy-rolling waves of the sea after a
tempest. These wave-like plains are often destitute of trees, except
a few scattering ones, but present to the eye an almost
boundless field of native herbage. Groves of oak sometimes
diversify those native meadows, or cover the ridges which bound
them. Very rarely does any rock appear above the surface.
The highest elevations, the Platte Mounds, and the Blue Mound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
are covered with soil and with trees. Numerous brooks of limpid
water traverse the plains, and find their way into either the Wisconsin,
Rock River, or the Mississippi. The common deer is still
in possession of its favorite haunts; and the traveller is very often
startled by flocks of the prairie-hen rising up in his path. The
surface soil is a rich black alluvion; it yields abundant crops of
corn, and, so far as they have been tried, all the cereal gramina.
I have never, either in the West or out of the West, seen a richer
soil, or more stately fields of corn and oats, than upon one of the
plateaux of the Blue Mound.</p>

<p>Such is the country which appears to be richer in ores of lead
than any other mineral district in the world&mdash;which yielded forty
millions of pounds in seven years&mdash;produced a single lump of
ore of two thousand cubic feet&mdash;and appears adequate to supply
almost any amount of this article that the demands of commerce
require.</p>

<p>The River of Galena rises in the mineral plains of Iowa county,
in that part of the Northwestern Territory which is attached, for
the purposes of temporary government, to Michigan. It is made
up of clear and permanent springs, and has a descent which affords
a very valuable water-power. This has been particularly
remarked at the curve called Mill-seat Bend. No change in its
general course, which is southwest, is, I believe, apparent after it
enters the northwest angle of the State of Illinois. The town of
Galena, the capital of the mining country, occupies a somewhat
precipitous semicircular bend, on the right (or north) bank of the
river, six or seven miles from its entrance into the Mississippi.
Backwater, from the latter, gives the stream itself the appearance,
as it bears the name, of a "river," and admits steamboat
navigation thus far. It is a rapid brook immediately above the
town, and of no further value for the purpose of navigation.
Lead is brought in from the smelting furnaces, on heavy ox-teams,
capable of carrying several tons at a load. I do not know
that water <i>has been</i>, or that it <i>cannot</i> be made subservient in the
transportation of this article from the mines. The streams themselves
are numerous and permanent, although they are small, and
it would require the aid of so many of these, on any projected
route, that it is to be feared the supply of water would be inadequate.
To remedy this deficiency, the Wisconsin itself might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
relied on. Could the waters of this river be conducted in a canal
along its valley from the portage to the bend at Arena, they
might, from this point, be deflected in a direct line to Galena.
This route would cut the mine district centrally, and afford the
upper tributaries of the Pekatolika and Fever Rivers as feeders.
Such a communication would open the way to a northern market,
and merchandise might be supplied by the way of Green Bay,
when the low state of water in the Mississippi prevents the
ascent of boats. It would, at all times, obviate the tedious voyage,
which goods ordered from the Atlantic cities have to perform
through the straits of Florida and Gulf of Mexico. A railroad
could be laid upon this route with equal, perhaps superior advantages.
These things may seem too much like making arrangements
for the next generation. But we cannot fix bounds to the
efforts of our spreading population, and spirit of enterprise. Nor,
after what we have seen in the way of internal improvement, in
our own day and generation, should we deem anything too hard
to be accomplished.</p>

<p>I set out from Galena in a light wagon, drawn by two horses,
about ten o'clock in the morning (August 17th), accompanied by
Mr. B. It had rained the night and morning of the day previous,
which rendered the streets and roads quite muddy. A marly
soil, easily penetrated by rain, was, however, as susceptible to the
influence of the sun, and, in a much shorter period than would
be imagined, the surface became dry. Although a heavy and
continued shower had thoroughly drenched the ground, and
covered it with superfluous water, but very little effects of it were
to be seen at this time. We ascended into the open plain country,
which appears in every direction around the town, and directed
our course to Gratiot's Grove. In this distance, which, on
our programme of the route, was put down, at fifteen miles, a
lively idea of the formation and character of the country is given.
The eye is feasted with the boundlessness of its range. Grass and
flowers spread before and beside the traveller, and, on looking
back, they fill up the vista behind him. He soon finds himself
in the midst of a sylvan scene. Groves fringe the tops of the
most distant elevations, and clusters of trees&mdash;more rarely, open
forests&mdash;are occasionally presented. The trees appear to be almost
exclusively of the species of white oak and rough-bark hickory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
Among the flowers, the plant called rosin-weed attracts attention
by its gigantic stature, and it is accompanied, as certainly as substance
by shadow, by the wild indigo, two plants which were
afterwards detected, of less luxuriant growth, on Fox River. The
roads are in their natural condition; they are excellent, except for
a few yards where streams are crossed. At such places there is
a plunge into soft, black muck, and it requires all the powers of
a horse harnessed to a wagon to emerge from the stream.</p>

<p>On reaching Gratiot's Grove, I handed letters of introduction
to Mr. H. and B. Gratiot. These gentlemen appear to be extensively
engaged in smelting. They conducted me to see the ore
prepared for smelting in the log furnace; and also the preparation
of such parts of it for the ash furnace as do not undergo complete
fusion in the first process. The ash furnace is a very simple kind
of air furnace, with a grate so arranged as to throw a reverberating
flame upon the hearth where the prepared ore is laid. It
is built against a declivity, and charged, by throwing the materials
to be operated upon, down the flue. A silicious flux is used;
and the scoria is tapped and suffered to flow out, from the side of
the furnace, before drawing off the melted lead. The latter is
received in an excavation made in the earth, from which it is
ladled out into iron moulds. The whole process is conducted in
the open air, with sometimes a slight shed. The lead ore is piled
in cribs of logs, which are roofed. Hammers, ladles, a kind of
tongs, and some other iron tools are required. The simplicity of
the process, the absence of external show in buildings, and the
direct and ready application of the means to the end, are remarkable,
as pleasing characteristics about the smelting establishment.</p>

<p>The ore used is the common sulphuret, with a foliated, glittering
and cubical fracture. It occurs with scarcely any adhering
gangue. Cubical masses of it are found, at some of the diggings,
which are studded over with minute crystals of calcareous spar.
These crystals, when examined, have the form of the dog-tooth
spar. This broad, square-shaped, and square-broken mineral, is
taken from <i>east and west leads</i>, is most easy to smelt, and yields
the greatest per centum of lead. It is estimated to produce fifty
per cent. from the log furnace, and about sixteen more when
treated with a flux in the ash furnace.</p>

<p>Miners classify their ore from its position in the mine. Ore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
from <i>east and west leads</i>, is raised from clay diggings, although
these diggings may be pursued under the first stratum of rock.
Ore from <i>north and south leads</i>, is termed "sheet minerals," and is
usually taken from rock diggings. The vein or sheet stands perpendicularly
in the fissure, and is usually struck in sinking from
six to ten feet. The sheet varies in thickness from six or eight
inches, in the broadest part, to not more than one. The great
mass found at "Irish diggings" was of this kind.</p>

<p>I observed, among the piles of ore at Gratiot's, the combination
of zinc with lead ore, which is denominated <i>dry bone</i>. It is cast
by as unproductive. Mr. B. Gratiot also showed me pieces of
the common ore which had undergone desulphuration in the log
furnace. Its natural splendor is increased by this process, so as
to have the appearance of highly burnished steel. He also presented
me some uniform masses of lead, recrystallized from a
metallic state, under the hearth of the ash furnace. The tendency
to rectangular structure in these delicate and fragile masses is
very remarkable. Crystallization appears to have taken place
under circumstances which opposed the production of a complete
and perfect cube or parallelogram, although there are innumerable
rectangles of each geometric form.</p>

<p>In the drive from Gratiot's to Willow Springs, we saw a succession
of the same objects that had formed the prominent features
of the landscape from Galena. The platte mounds, which had
appeared on our left all the morning, continued visible until we
entered the grove that embraces the site of the springs. Little
mounds of red earth frequently appeared above the grass, to testify
to the labors of miners along this part of the route. In taking
a hasty survey of some of the numerous excavations of Irish diggings,
I observed among the rubbish small flat masses of a yellowish
white amorphous mineral substance of great weight. I
have not had time to submit it to any tests. It appears too heavy
and compact for the earthy yellow oxide of lead. I should not
be disappointed to find it an oxide of zinc. No rock stratum protrudes
from the ground in this part of the country. The consolidated
masses, thrown up from the diggings, appear to be silicated
limestone, often friable, and not crystalline. Galena is found in
open fissures in this rock.</p>

<p>We reached the springs in the dusk of the evening, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
good accommodations at Ray's. Distance from Galena thirty
miles.</p>

<p>The rain fell copiously during the night, and on the morning
(18th) gave no signs of a speedy cessation. Those who travel
ought often, however, to call to mind the remark of Xenophon,
that "pleasure is the result of toil," and not permit slight impediments
to arrest them, particularly when they have definite points
to make. We set forward in a moderate rain, but in less than
an hour had the pleasure to perceive signs of its mitigating, and
before nine o'clock it was quite clear. We stopped a short time
at Bracken's furnace. Mr. Bracken gave me specimens of organic
remains, in the condition of earthy calcareous carbonates, procured
on a neighboring ridge. He described the locality as being
plentiful in casts and impressions such as he exhibited, which
appeared to have been removed from the surface of a shelly limestone.
At Rock-Branch diggings, I found masses of calcareous
spar thrown from the pits. The surface appears to have been
much explored for lead in this vicinity. I stopped to examine
Vanmater's lead. It had been a productive one, and affords a
fair example of what are called east and west leads. I observed
a compass standing on the line of the lead, and asked Mr. V.
whether much reliance was to be placed upon the certainty of
striking the lead by the aid of this instrument. He said that it
was much relied on. That the course of the leads was definite.
The present one varied from a due east and west line but nine
minutes, and the lead had been followed without much difficulty.
The position of the ore was about forty feet below the surface.
Of this depth about thirty-six feet consisted of the surface rock
and its earthy covering. A vein of marly clay, enveloping the
ore, was then penetrated. A series of pits had been sunk on the
course of it, and the earth and ore in the interstices removed, and
drawn to the surface by a windlass and bucket. Besides the ore,
masses of iron pyrites had been thrown out, connected with galena.
In stooping to detach some pieces from one of these masses, I
placed my feet on the verge of an abandoned pit, around which
weeds and bushes had grown. My face was, however, averted
from the danger; but, on beholding it, I was made sensible that
the least deviation from a proper balance would have pitched me
into it. It was forty feet deep. The danger I had just escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
fell to the lot of Mr. B.'s dog, who, probably deceived by the
growth of bushes, fell in. Whether killed or not, it was impossible
to tell, and we were obliged to leave the poor animal, under
a promise of Mr. V., that he would cause a windlass to be removed
to the pit, to ascertain his fate.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock we reached Mineral Point, the seat of justice
of Iowa county. I delivered an introductory letter to Mr. Ansley,
who had made a discovery of copper ore in the vicinity, and
through his politeness, visited the locality. The discovery was
made in sinking pits in search of lead ore. Small pieces of green
carbonate of copper were found on striking the rock, which is
apparently silico-calcareous, and of a very friable structure.
From one of the excavations, detached masses of the sulphuret,
blue and green mingled, were raised. These masses are enveloped
with ochery clay.</p>

<p>In riding out on horseback to see this locality, I passed over
the ridge of land which first received the appellation of "Mineral
Point." No digging was observed in process, but the heaps of
red marly clay, the vigorous growth of shrubbery around them,
and the number of open or partially filled pits, remain to attest
the labor which was formerly devoted in the search for lead. And
this search is said to have been amply rewarded. The track of
discovery is conspicuously marked by these excavations, which
often extend, in a direct line, on the cardinal points, as far as the
eye can reach. Everywhere the marly clay formation appears
to have been relied on for the ore, and much of it certainly appears
to be <i>in sitû</i> in it. It bears no traces of attrition; and its
occurrence in regular leads forbids the supposition of its being
an oceanic arrangement of mineral detritus. At Vanmater's, the
metalliferous clay marl is overlaid by a grayish sedimentary
limestone. Different is the geological situation of what is denominated
<i>gravel ore</i>, of which I noticed piles, on the route from
Gratiot's. This bears evident marks of attrition, and appears to
have been uniformly taken from diluvial earth.</p>

<p>On returning to the village from this excursion, I found Mr. B.
ready to proceed, and we lost no time in making the next point
in our proposed route. A drive of five miles brought us to the
residence of Colonel Dodge, whose zeal and enterprise in opening
this portion of our western country for settlement, give him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
claims to be looked up to as a public benefactor. I here met the
superintendent of the mines (Captain Legate), and after spending
some time in conversation on the resources and prospects of the
country, and partaking of the hospitalities politely offered by
Colonel D. and his intelligent family, we pursued our way. The
village of Dodgeville lies at the distance of four miles. Soon after
passing through it some part of our tackle gave way, in crossing
a gully, and I improved the opportunity of the delay to visit the
adjacent diggings, which are extensive. The ore is found as at
other mines, in regular leads, and not scattered about promiscuously
in the red marl. Masses of brown oxide of iron were
more common here than I had noticed them elsewhere. Among
the rubbish of the diggings, fragments of hornstone occur. They
appear to be, most commonly, portions of nodules, which exhibit,
on being fractured, various discolorings.</p>

<p>Night overtook us before we entered Porter's Grove, which is
also the seat of mining and smelting operations. We are indebted
to the hospitality of Mr. M., of whom my companion was
an acquaintance, for opening his door to us, at an advanced hour
of the evening. Distance from Willow Springs, twenty-five
miles.</p>

<p>There is no repose for a traveller. We retired to rest at a late
hour, and rose at an early one. The morning (19th) was hazy,
and we set forward while the dew was heavy on the grass. Our
route still lay through a prairie country. The growth of native
grass, bent down with dew, nearly covered the road, so that our
horses' legs were continually bathed. The rising sun was a very
cheerful sight, but as our road lay up a long ascent, we soon felt
its wilting effects. Nine miles of such driving, with not a single
grove to shelter us, brought us to Mr. Brigham's, at the foot of
the Blue Mound, being the last house in the direction to Fort
Winnebago. The distance from Galena is sixty-four miles, and
this area embraces the present field of mining operations. In
rapidly passing over it, mines, furnaces, dwelling-houses, mining
villages, inclosed fields, upland prairies (an almost continued
prairie), groves, springs, and brooks, have formed the prominent
features of the landscape. The impulse to the settlement of the
country was first given by its mineral wealth; and it brought
here, as it were by magic, an enterprising and active population.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
It is evident that a far greater amount of labor was a few years
ago engaged in mining operations; but the intrinsic value of the
lands has operated to detain the present population, which may
be considered as permanent. The lands are beautifully disposed,
well watered, well drained by natural streams, and easily brought
into cultivation. Crops have everywhere repaid the labors of the
farmer; and, thus far, the agricultural produce of the country has
borne a fair price. The country appears to afford every facility
for raising cattle, horses, and hogs. Mining, the cardinal interest
heretofore, has not ceased in the degree that might be inferred
from the depression of the lead market; and it will be pursued,
with increased activity, whenever the purposes of commerce call
for it. In the present situation of the country, there appear to
be two objects essential to the lasting welfare of the settlements:
first, a title to their lands from Congress; second, a northern
market for the products of their mines and farms. To these, a
<i>third</i> requisite may be considered auxiliary, namely, the establishment
of the seat of territorial government at some point west of
Lake Michigan, where its powers may be more readily exercised,
and the reciprocal obligations of governor and people more vividly
felt.</p>

<p>Mr. Brigham, in whom I was happy to recognize an esteemed
friend, conducted us over his valuable plantation. He gave me
a mass of a white, heavy metallic substance, taken as an accompanying
mineral, from a lead of Galena, which he has recently
discovered in a cave. Without instituting any examination of it
but such as its external characters disclose, it may be deemed a
native carbonate of lead. The mass from which it was broken
weighed ninety or one hundred pounds. And its occurrence, at
the lead, was not alone.</p>

<p>From the Blue Mound to Fort Winnebago is an estimated distance
of fifty-six miles. The country is, however, entirely in a
state of nature. The trace is rather obscure; but, with a knowledge
of the general geography and face of the country, there is
no difficulty in proceeding with a light wagon, or even a loaded
team, as the Indian practice of firing the prairies every fall has
relieved the surface from underbrush and fallen timber. After
driving a few miles, we encountered two Winnebagoes on horseback,
the forward rider having a white man in ties behind him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
The latter informed us that his name was H., that he had come
out to Twelve-mile Creek, for the purpose of locating himself
there, and was in pursuit of a hired man, who had gone off, with
some articles of his property, the night previous. With this relation,
and a <i>boshu</i><a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">&nbsp;[274]</a> for the natives, with whom we had no means
of conversing, we continued our way, without further incident, to
Duck Creek, a distance of ten miles. We here struck the path,
which is one of the boundary lines, in the recent purchase from
the Winnebagoes. It is a deeply marked horse path, cutting
quite through the prairie sod, and so much used by the natives as
to prevent grass from growing on it; in this respect, it is as well-defined
a landmark as "blazed tree," or "saddle." The surveyor
appointed to run out the lines, had placed mile-posts on the
route, but the Winnebagoes, with a prejudice against the practice
which is natural, pulled up many, and defaced others. When
we had gone ten miles further, we began to see the glittering of
water through the trees, and we soon found ourselves on the
margin of a clear lake. I heard no name for this handsome
sheet of water. It is one of the four lakes, which are connected
with each other by a stream, and have their outlet into Rock
River, through a tributary called the Guskihaw. We drove
through the margin of it, where the shores were sandy, and innumerable
small unio shells were driven up. Most of these
small pieces appeared to be helices. Standing tent-poles, and
other remains of Indian encampments, appeared at this place. A
rock stratum, dark and weather-beaten, apparently sandstone,
jutted out into the lake. A little further, we passed to the left of
an abandoned village. By casting our eyes across the lake, we
observed the new position which had been selected and occupied
by the Winnebagoes. We often assign wrong motives, when we
undertake to reason for the Indian race; but in the present instance,
we may presume that their removal was influenced by
too near a position to the boundary path.</p>

<p>We drove to the second brook, beyond the lake, and encamped.</p>

<p>Comfort in an encampment depends very much upon getting a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
good fire. In this we totally failed last night, owing to our having
but a small piece of spunk, which ignited and burned out without
inflaming our kindling materials. The atmosphere was damp,
but not sufficiently cooled to quiet the ever-busy mosquito. Mr.
B. deemed it a hardship that he could not boil the kettle, so as to
have the addition of tea to our cold repast. I reminded him that
there was a bright moon, and that it did not rain; and that, for
myself, I had fared so decidedly worse, on former occasions, that
I was quite contented with the light of the moon and a dry
blanket. By raising up and putting a fork under the wagon-tongue,
and spreading our tent-cloth over it, I found the means
of insulating ourselves from the insect hordes, but it was not until
I had pitched my mosquito net within it that we found repose.</p>

<p>On awaking in the morning (20th), we found H., who had
passed us the day before in company with the Winnebagoes, lying
under the wagon. He had returned from pursuing the fugitive,
and had overtaken us, after twelve o'clock at night. He complained
of being cold. We admitted him into the wagon, and
drove on to reach his camp at Twelve-mile Creek. In crossing
what he denominated Seven-mile Prairie, I observed on our right
a prominent wall of rock, surmounted with image-stones. The
rock itself consisted of sandstone. Elongated water-worn masses
of stone had been set up, so as to resemble, at a distance, the
figures of men. The illusion had been strengthened by some
rude paints. This had been the serious or the sportive work of
Indians. It is not to be inferred, hence, that the Winnebagoes
are idolaters. But there is a strong tendency to idolatry in the
minds of the North American Indians. They do not bow before
a carved image, shaped like Dagon or Juggernaut; but they rely
upon their guardian spirits, or personal manitos, for aid in exigencies,
and impute to the skins of animals, which are preserved
with religious care, the power of gods. Their medicine institution
is also a gross and bold system of semi-deification connected with
magic, witchcraft, and necromancy. Their jossakeeds are impostors
and jugglers of the grossest stamp. Their wabenos address
Satan directly for power; and their metais, who appear to be least
idolatrous, rely more upon the invisible agency of spirits and
magic influence, than upon the physical properties of the medicines
they exhibit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
On reaching Twelve-mile Creek, we found a yoke of steers of
H., in a pen, which had been tied there two days and nights without
water. He evinced, however, an obliging disposition, and,
after refreshing ourselves and our horses, we left him to complete
the labors of a "local habitation." The intermediate route to
Fort Winnebago afforded few objects of either physical or mental
interest. The upland soil, which had become decidedly thinner
and more arenaceous, after reaching the Lake, appears to increase
in sterility on approaching the Wisconsin. And the occurrence
of <i>lost rocks</i> (primitive boulders), as Mr. B. happily termed them,
which are first observed after passing the Blue Mound, becomes
more frequent in this portion of the country, denoting our approach
to the borders of the northwestern primitive formation.
This formation, we have now reason to conclude, extends in an
angle, so far south as to embrace a part of Fox River, above
Apukwa Lake.</p>

<p>Anticipated difficulties always appear magnified. This we verified
in crossing Duck Creek, near its entrance into the Wisconsin.
We found the adjoining bog nearly dry, and drove through the
stream without the water entering into the body of the wagon.
It here commenced raining. Having but four miles to make, and
that a level prairie, we pushed on. But the rain increased, and
poured down steadily and incessantly till near sunset. In the
midst of this rain-storm we reached the fort, about one o'clock,
and crossed over to the elevated ground occupied by the Indian
Department, where my sojourn, while awaiting the expedition,
was rendered as comfortable as the cordial greeting and kind
attention of Mr. Kinzie, the agent, and his intelligent family, could
make it.</p>

<p>A recapitulation of the distances from Galena makes the route
as follows, viz: Gratiot's Grove, fifteen miles; Willow Springs,
fifteen; Mineral Point, seven; Dodgeville, nine; Porter's Grove,
nine; Blue Mound, nine; Duck Creek, ten; Lake, ten; Twelve-mile
Creek, twenty-four; Crossing of Duck Creek, eight; and
Fort Winnebago, four; total, one hundred and twenty miles.</p>

<p class="section">3. <i>Official Report of the Exploratory Expedition to the Actual Source
of the Mississippi River in 1832.</i></p>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Office of the Indian Agency of Sault Ste. Marie</span>,<br />
Sept. 1, 1832.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I had the honor to inform you, on the 15th ultimo, of my
return from the sources of the Mississippi, and that I should communicate
the details of my observations to you as soon as they
could be prepared.</p>

<p>On reaching the remotest point visited heretofore by official
authority, I found that the waters on that summit were favorable
to my tracing this river to its utmost sources. This point having
been left undetermined by prior expeditions, I determined to
avail myself of the occasion to take Indian guides, with light
canoes, and, after encamping my heavy force, to make the ascent.
It was represented to be practicable in five days. I accomplished
it, by great diligence, in three. The distance is 158 miles above
Cass Lake. There are many sharp rapids, which made the trial
severe. The river expands into numerous lakes.</p>

<p>After passing about forty miles north of Red Cedar Lake, during
which we ascended a summit, I entered a fine large lake, which,
to avoid repetitions in our geographical names, I called Queen
Anne's Lake. From this point the ascent of the Mississippi was
due south; and it was finally found to have its origin in a handsome
lake, of some seven miles in extent, on the height of land
to which I gave the name of Itasca.</p>

<p>This lake lies in latitude 47° 13' 25". It lies at an altitude of
1,575 feet, by the barometer, above the Gulf of Mexico. It affords
me satisfaction to say, that, by this discovery, the geographical
point of the origin of this river is definitely fixed. Materials
for maps and plans of the entire route have been carefully collected
by Lieut. James Allen, of the U. S. Army, who accompanied
me, with a small detachment of infantry, as high as
Cass Lake; and, having encamped them at that point, with my
extra men, he proceeded with me to Itasca Lake. The distance
which is thus added to the Mississippi, agreeably to him, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>164 miles, making its entire length, by the most authentic estimates,
to be 3,200 miles. In this distance there are numerous
and arduous rapids, in which the total amount of ascent to be
overcome is 173 feet.</p>

<p>Councils were held with the Indians at Fond du Lac, at Sandy
Lake, Cass Lake, at the mouth of the Great De Corbeau River, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In returning, I visited the military bands at Leech Lake; passing
from thence to its source, and descending the whole length of
the Crow-wing River, and thence to St. Anthony's Falls, I
assembled the Sioux at the agency of St. Peter's, and at the Little
Crow's village. The Chippewas of the St. Croix and Broule Rivers
were particularly visited. Many thousands of the Chippewa and
Sioux nations were seen and counselled with, including their most
distinguished chiefs and warriors. Everywhere they disclaimed a
connection with Black Hawk and his schemes. I left the Mississippi,
about forty miles above the point where, in a few days, the
Sauk chief was finally captured and his forces overthrown; and,
reaching the waters of Lake Superior, at the mouth of the Brule,
returned from that point to the agency at Sault de Ste. Marie.</p>

<p>The flag of the Union has secured respect from the tribes at
every point; and I feel confident in declaring the Chippewas and
Sioux, as tribes, unconnected with the Black Hawk movement.</p>

VACCINATION OF THE INDIANS.</p>

<p class="hanging indent">4. <i>Report of the number and position of the Indians vaccinated on the
Exploratory Expedition to the Sources of the Mississippi, conducted
by Mr. Schoolcraft, in 1832.</i> By Dr. <span class="smcap">Douglass Houghton</span>.</p>

<p class="date">
<span class="smcap">Sault Ste. Marie</span>, Sept. 21, 1832.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In conformity with your instructions, I take the earliest
opportunity to lay before you such facts as I have collected,
touching the vaccination of the Chippewa Indians, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
progress of the late expedition into their country: and also "of
the prevalence, from time to time, of the smallpox" among them.</p>

<p>The accompanying table will serve to illustrate the "ages, sex,
tribe, and local situation" of those Indians who have been vaccinated
by me. With the view of illustrating more fully their local
situation, I have arranged those bands residing upon the shores
of Lake Superior; those residing in the Folle Avoine country
(or that section of country lying between the highlands southwest
from Lake Superior, and the Mississippi River); and those residing
near the sources of the Mississippi River, separately.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Indians noticed in this table were vaccinated at
their respective villages; yet I did not fail to vaccinate those
whom we chanced to meet in their hunting or other excursions.</p>

<p>I have embraced, with the Indians of the frontier bands, those
half-breeds, who, in consequence of having adopted more or less
the habits of the Indian, may be identified with him.</p>

<p>But little difficulty has occurred in convincing the Indians of
the efficacy of vaccination; and the universal dread in which they
hold the appearance of the smallpox among them, rendered it an
easy task to overcome their prejudices, whatever they chanced to
be. The efficacy of the vaccine disease is well appreciated, even
by the most interior of the Chippewa Indians; and so universal is
this information, that only one instance occurred where the Indian
had never heard of the disease.</p>

<p>In nearly every instance the opportunity which was presented
for vaccination, was embraced with cheerfulness and apparent
gratitude; at the same time manifesting great anxiety that, for
the safety of the whole, each one of the band should undergo the
operation. When objections were made to vaccination, they were
not usually made because the Indian doubted the protective power
of the disease, but because he supposed (never having seen its
progress), that the remedy must nearly equal the disease which it
was intended to counteract.</p>

<p>Our situation, while travelling, did not allow me sufficient time
to test the result of the vaccination in most instances; but an occasional
return to bands where the operation had been performed,
enabled me, in those bands, either to note the progress of the disease,
or to judge from the cicatrices marking the original situation
of the pustules, the cases in which the disease had proved
successful.</p>

<p>About one-fourth of the whole number were vaccinated directly
from the pustules of patients laboring under the disease; while
the remaining three-fourths were vaccinated from crusts, or from
virus which had been several days on hand. I did not pass by a
single opportunity for securing the crusts and virus from the
arms of healthy patients; and to avoid, as far as possible, the
chance of giving rise to a disease of a spurious kind, I invariably
made use of those crusts and that virus, for the purposes of vaccination,
which had been most recently obtained. To secure, as
far as possible, against the chances of escaping the vaccine disease,
I invariably vaccinated in each arm.</p>

<p>Of the whole number of Indians vaccinated, I have either
watched the progress of the disease, or examined the cicatrices of
about seven hundred. An average of one in three of those vaccinated
from crusts has failed, while of those vaccinated directly
from the arm of a person laboring under the disease, not more
than one in twenty has failed to take effect&mdash;when the disease did
not make its appearance after vaccination, I have invariably, as
the cases came under my examination, revaccinated until a favorable
result has been obtained.</p>

<p>Of the different bands of Indians vaccinated, a large proportion
of the following have, as an actual examination has shown, undergone
thoroughly the effects of the disease; viz: Sault Ste. Marie,
Keweena Bay, La Pointe, and Cass Lake, being seven hundred
and fifty-one in number; while of the remaining thirteen hundred
and seventy-eight, of other bands, I think it may safely be calculated
that more than three-fourths have passed effectually under
the influence of the vaccine disease: and as directions to revaccinate
all those in whom the disease failed, together with instructions
as to time and manner of vaccination, were given to
the chiefs of the different bands, it is more than probable that,
where the bands remained together a sufficient length of time,
the operation of revaccination has been performed by themselves.</p>

<p>Upon our return to Lake Superior, I had reason to suspect, on
examining several cicatrices, that two of the crusts furnished by
the surgeon-general, in consequence of a partial decomposition,
gave rise to a spurious disease, and these suspicions were confirmed
when revaccinating with genuine vaccine matter, when
the true disease was communicated. Nearly all those Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
vaccinated with those two crusts, have been vaccinated, and
passed regularly though the vaccine disease.</p>

<p>The answers to my repeated inquiries respecting the introduction,
progress, and fatality of the smallpox, would lead me to
infer that the disease has made its appearance at least five times,
among the bands of Chippewa Indians noticed in the accompanying
table of vaccination.</p>

<p>The smallpox appears to have been wholly unknown to the
Chippewas of Lake Superior until about 1750; when a war-party,
of more than one hundred young men, from the bands resident
near the head of the lake, having visited Montreal for the purpose
of assisting the French in their then existing troubles with the
English, became infected with the disease, and but few of the
party survived to reach their homes. It does not appear, although
they made a precipitate retreat to their own country, that the
disease was at this time communicated to any others of the tribe.</p>

<p>About the year 1770, the disease appeared a second time
among the Chippewas, but, unlike that which preceded it, it was
communicated to the more northern bands.</p>

<p>The circumstances connected with its introduction are related
nearly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some time in the fall of 1767 or 8, a trader who had ascended
the Mississippi, and established himself near Leech Lake, was
robbed of his goods by the Indians residing at that lake; and,
in consequence of his exertions in defending his property, he died
soon after.</p>

<p>These facts became known to the directors of the Fur Company,
at Mackinac; and, each successive year after, requests were
sent to the Leech Lake Indians, that they should visit Mackinac,
and make reparation for the goods they had taken, by a payment
of furs, at the same time threatening punishment in case of a
refusal. In the spring of 1770, the Indians saw fit to comply
with this request; and a deputation from the band visited Mackinac,
with a quantity of furs, which they considered an equivalent
for the goods which had been taken. The deputation was
received with politeness by the directors of the Company, and the
difficulties readily adjusted. When this was effected, a cask of
liquor and a flag closely rolled were presented to the Indians as a
token of friendship. They were at the same time strictly enjoined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
neither to break the seal of the cask nor to unroll the flag, until
they had reached the heart of their own country. This they
promised to observe; but while returning, and after having
travelled many days, the chief of the deputation made a feast for
the Indians of the band at Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, upon
which occasion he unsealed the cask and unrolled the flag for
the gratification of his guests. The Indians drank of the liquor,
and remained in a state of inebriation during several days. The
rioting was over, and they were fast recovering from its effects,
when several of the party were seized with violent pain. This
was attributed to the liquor they had drunk; but the pain increasing,
they were induced to drink deeper of the poisonous drug, and
in this inebriated state several of the party died, before the real
cause was suspected. Other like cases occurred; and it was not
long before one of the war-party who had visited Montreal in
1750, and who had narrowly escaped with his life, recognized the
disease as the same which had attacked their party at that time.
It proved to be so; and of those Indians then at Fond du Lac,
about three hundred in number, nearly the whole were swept off
by it. Nor did it stop here; for numbers of those at Fond du Lac,
at the time the disease made its appearance, took refuge among
the neighboring bands; and although it did not extend easterly on
Lake Superior, it is believed that not a single band of Chippewas
north or west from Fond du Lac escaped its ravages. Of a large
band then resident at Cass Lake, near the source of the Mississippi
River, only one person, a child, escaped. The others having been
attacked by the disease, died before any opportunity for dispersing
was offered. The Indians at this day are firmly of the opinion
that the smallpox was at this time communicated through the
articles presented to their brethren by the agent of the Fur Company
at Mackinac; and that it was done for the purpose of punishing
them more severely for their offences.</p>

<p>The most western bands of Chippewas relate a singular allegory
of the introduction of the smallpox into their country by a war-party,
returning from the plains of the Missouri, as nearly as information
will enable me to judge, in the year 1784. It does not
appear that, at this time, the disease extended to the bands east of
Fond du Lac; but it is represented to have been extremely fatal
to those bands north and west from there.</p>

In 1802 or 3, the smallpox made its appearance among the Indians
residing at the Sault Ste. Marie, but did not extend to the
bands west from that place. The disease was introduced by a voyager,
in the employ of the Northwest Fur Company, who had just
returned from Montreal; and although all communication with
him was prohibited, an Indian imprudently having made him a
visit, was infected with and transmitted the disease to others of
the band. When once communicated, it raged with great violence,
and of a large band scarcely one of those then at the village
survived, and the unburied bones still remain, marking the situation
they occupied. From this band the infection was communicated
to a band residing upon St. Joseph's Island, and many died
of it; but the surgeon of the military post then there, succeeded,
by judicious and early measures, in checking it before the infection
became general.</p>

<p>In 1824, the smallpox again made its appearance among the
Indians at the Sault Ste. Marie. It was communicated by a voyager
to the Indians upon Drummond's Island, Lake Huron; and
through them several families at Sault Ste. Marie became infected.
Of those belonging to the latter place, more than twenty in number,
only two escaped. The disease is represented to have been
extremely fatal to the Indians at Drummond's Island.</p>

<p>Since 1824, the smallpox is not known to have appeared
among the Indians at the Sault Ste. Marie, nor among the Chippewas
north or west from that place. But the Indians of these
bands still tremble at the bare name of a disease which (next to
the compounds of alcohol) has been one of the greatest scourges
that has ever overtaken them since their first communication
with the whites. The disease, when once communicated to a
band of Indians, rages with a violence wholly unknown to the
civilized man. The Indian, guided by present feeling, adopts a
course of treatment (if indeed it deserves that appellation) which
not unfrequently arms the disease with new power. An attack
is but a warning to the poor and helpless patient to prepare for
death, which will almost assuredly soon follow. His situation
under these circumstances is truly deplorable; for while in a
state that even, with proper advice, he would of himself recover,
he adds fresh fuel to the flame which is already consuming him,
under the delusive hope of gaining relief. The intoxicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
draught (when it is within his reach) is not among the last remedies
to which he resorts, to produce a lethargy from which he is
never to recover. Were the friends of the sick man, even under
these circumstances, enabled to attend him, his sufferings might
be, at least, somewhat mitigated; but they too are, perhaps, in a
similar situation, and themselves without even a single person to
minister to their wants. Death comes to the poor invalid, and,
perhaps, even as a welcome guest, to rid him of his suffering.</p>

<p>By a comparison of the number of Indians vaccinated upon
the borders of Lake Superior with the actual population, it will be
seen that the proportion who have passed through the vaccine
disease is so great as to secure them against any general prevalence
of the smallpox; and perhaps it is sufficient to prevent the
introduction of the disease to the bands beyond, through this
channel. But in the Folle Avoine country it is not so. Of the
large bands of Indians residing in that section of country, only a
small fraction have been vaccinated; while of other bands, not a
single person has passed through the disease.</p>

<p>Their local situation undoubtedly renders it of the first importance
that the benefits of vaccination should be extended to them.
Their situation may be said to render them a connecting link
between the southern and northwestern bands of Chippewas;
and while on the south they are liable to receive the virus of the
smallpox from the whites and Indians, the passage of the disease
through them to their more northern brethren would only be
prevented by their remaining, at that time, completely separated.
Every motive of humanity towards the suffering Indian, would
lead to extend to him this protection against a disease he holds in
constant dread, and of which he knows, by sad experience, the
fatal effects. The protection he will prize highly, and will give
in return the only boon a destitute man is capable of giving; the
deep-felt gratitude of an overflowing heart.</p>

<h3>5. SCENERY.</h3>

<h4>X.<br />
<i>Scenery of Lake Superior.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry R. Schoolcraft</span>.</h4>

<p>Few portions of America can vie in scenic attractions with this
interior sea. Its size alone gives it all the elements of grandeur;
but these have been heightened by the mountain masses which
nature has piled along its shores. In some places, these masses
consist of vast walls, of coarse gray, or drab-colored sandstone,
placed horizontally, until they have attained many hundred feet
in height above the water. The action of such an immense liquid
area, forced against these crumbling walls by tempests, has caused
wide and deep arches to be worn into the solid structure, at their
base, into which the billows roll, with a noise resembling low-pealing
thunder. By this means, large areas of the impending
mass are at length undermined and precipitated into the lake,
leaving the split and rent parts, from which they have separated,
standing like huge misshapen turrets and battlements. Such is
the varied coast, called the Pictured Rocks.</p>

<p>At other points of the coast, volcanic forces have operated,
lifting up these level strata into positions nearly vertical, and
leaving them to stand, like the leaves of a vast open book. At
the same time, the volcanic rocks sent up from below, have risen
in high mountains, with ancient gaping craters. Such is the condition
of the disturbed stratification at the Porcupine Mountains.</p>

<p>The basin and bed of this lake act like a vast geological mortar,
in which the masses of broken and fallen stones are whirled
about and ground down, till all the softer ones, such as the sandstones,
are brought into the state of pure yellow sand. This sand
is driven ashore by the waves, where it is shoved up in long
wreaths, and dried by the sun. The winds now take it up, and
spread it inland, or pile it immediately along the coast, where it
presents itself in mountain masses. Such are the great sand
dunes of the Grande Sables.</p>

<p>There are yet other theatres of action for this sublime mass of
inland waters, where the lake has manifested, perhaps, still more
strongly, its abrasive powers. The whole force of its waters, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
the impulse of a northwest tempest, is directed against prominent
portions of the shore, which consist of black and hard volcanic
rocks. Solid as these are, the waves have found an entrance in
veins of spar, or minerals of softer texture, and have thus been
led on their devastating course inland, tearing up large fields of
amygdaloid, or other rock; or, left portions of them standing in
rugged knobs, or promontories. Such are the east and west coasts
of the great peninsula of Keweena, which have recently become
the theatre of mining operations.</p>

<p>When the visitor to these remote and boundless waters comes
to see this wide and varied scene of complicated geological disturbances
and scenic magnificence, he is absorbed in wonder and
astonishment. The eye, once introduced to this panorama of
waters, is never done looking and admiring. Scene after scene,
cliff after cliff, island after island, and vista after vista are presented.
One day's scenes of the traveller are but the prelude to
another; and when weeks, and even months, have been spent in
picturesque rambles along its shores, he has only to ascend some
of its streams, and go inland a few miles, to find falls, and cascades,
and cataracts of the most beautiful or magnificent character.
Go where he will, there is something to attract him. Beneath his
feet are pebbles of agates; the water is of the most crystalline
purity. The sky is filled, at sunset with the most gorgeous piles
of clouds. The air itself is of the purest and most inspiring
kind. To visit such a scene is to draw health from its purest
sources, and while the eye revels in intellectual delights, the soul
is filled with the liveliest symbols of God, and the most striking
evidences of his creative power.</p>


<p class="center">(b) <i>Letters of Mr. M. Woolsey.</i> <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>, 1836.
Oneöta, p. 322.</p>

<p>These spirited and graphic letters are unavoidably excluded.
The evidence they bear to the purity of principle, justness of
taste, and excellence of character of a young man, now no more,
ought to preserve his name from oblivion. He accompanied me
in 1831, as a volunteer, in a leisure moment, an admirer of nature,
seeking health.</p>

what is known as General Wayne's war, extended to Michilimackinac, the remotest
British garrison. The region northwest of this post was occupied by numerous
tribes of Indians, who continued to be supplied with goods by British traders till
after the close of the war of 1812. In 1816, Congress passed an act confining the
trade to American citizens. Under this state of affairs, the Northwest Company of
Montreal sold out their trading-posts and fixtures, northwest of Michilimackinac,
to Mr. John Jacob Astor, of New York, who, from an account of one of his active
factors, invested about $300,000 per annum in merchandise adapted to the Indian
habits.</p>

principally Frenchmen, who were the descendants of the original settlers
of the time of Louis XIV. In 1835, the population had so increased, chiefly by emigration
from the older States, that the inhabitants applied for admission into
the Union. The act of Congress admitting it was passed in 1836. In 1846, it had
212,267 souls. By the seventh national census, in 1850, it is shown to have a population
of 397,654, entitling it to four representatives in Congress, with a large fraction.
Its resources, its healthful climate, fertile soil, and very advantageous position on
the great chain of navigable waters of the Upper Lakes, must insure a rapid development
of its means and resources, and place the State, in a few years, in a high rank
among the circle of American States.</p>

of Ireland, where his family possessed an estate called "Craige," near the celebrated
Giant's Causeway. He came to this country during the first Presidential
term of Washington, and settled at St. Mary's, about 1793. He was a gentleman
of taste, reading, refined feeling, and cultivated manners, which enabled him to
direct the education of his children, an object to which he assiduously devoted himself;
and his residence was long known as the seat of hospitality and refinement to
all who visited the region. In 1814, his premises were visited, during his absence,
by a part of the force who entered the St. Mary's, under Colonel Croghan, and his
private property subjected to pillage, from a misapprehension, created by some
evil-minded persons, that he was an agent of the Northwest Company. Genial,
social, kind, and benevolent, his society was much sought, and he was sometimes
imposed on by those who had been received into his employments and trusts (as in
the reports which carried the Americans to his domicil in 1814). He died at St.
Mary's, in 1828, leaving behind, among his papers, evidence that his leisure hours
were sometimes lightened by literary employments. Mr. Johnston, by marrying the
daughter of the ruling chief of this region, placed himself in the position of another
Rolfe. Espousing, in Christian marriage, the daughter of Wabjeeg, he became the
son-in-law of another Powhatan; thus establishing such a connection between the
Hibernian and Chippewa races, as the former had done between the English and
Powhetanic stocks.</p>

A ship-canal is now (1853) in the process of being constructed at these
falls, by the State of Michigan, under a grant of public land for that purpose,
from Congress. It is to consist of two locks of equal lift, dividing the aggregate
fall. This canal will add the basin of Lake Superior to the line of lake navigation.
It will enable ships and steamers to enter the St. Louis River of Fond du
Lac, and to reach a point in latitude corresponding to Independence, on the Missouri.
No other point of the lake chain reaches so far by some hundreds of
miles towards the Rocky Mountains; and this canal will eventually be the outlet to
the Atlantic cities of the copper and other mines of Lake Superior, and of the
agricultural and mineral products of all the higher States of the Upper Mississippi
and of the Missouri, and a part of Oregon and Washington on the Pacific.</p>

of the Montreal and Chippewa Rivers. This bird is called by the Chippewas Wabish
Kagagee, a name derived from <i>Wabishkau</i>, white animate, and <i>Kaw-gaw-gee</i>, a
crow. The three-toed woodpecker visits its forests. The T. polyglottis has been
seen as far north as the Island of Michilimackinac. In the spring of 1823, a species
of grosbeak visited St. Mary's, of which I transmitted a specimen to the New
York Lyceum of Natural History, where it received the name of Evening Grosbeak.</p>

under my charge an expedition into the Indian country which ascended this river,
with a view to penetrate through the intervening region to the Mississippi. Indian
canoes were employed, as being best adapted to its rapids and portages, which were
managed by <i>voyageurs</i>. A detachment of infantry, under Lieut. R. Clary, was added.
The tribes in this secluded region were then meditating the outbreak which eventuated
the next year in the Black Hawk War. This expedition ascended the river
through a most embarrassing series of rapids and rafts, which often choked up its
channel for miles, into a long lake, on its summit, called Kagenogumaug. From
the northwest end of this, it passed, from lake to lake, to the Namakagun fork of
the River St. Croix of the Mississippi, descended that stream to Yellow River, then
retraced the Namakagun to a portage to Ottowa Lake, a source of Chippewa River, then
to a portage into Lac Chetac, the source of the Red Cedar, or Follavoine River, and
pursued the latter to the main channel of the Chippewa, and by the latter into the
Mississippi, which it enters at the foot of Lake Pepin; thence down the Mississippi
to Prairie du Chien, and through the present area of the State of Wisconsin,
by the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers, to Green Bay; thence through Lakes Michigan
and Huron to Sault de Ste Marie.</p>

the exploration of its sources, in 1832, I ascended the River St. Croix quite to its
source in St. Croix Lake. A short portage, across a sandy summit, terminated
at the head springs of the Wisacoda, which, from a very narrow and tortuous
channel, is soon increased in volume by tributaries, and becomes a copious stream.
Thus swelled in volume, it is dashed down an inclined plane, for nearly seventy
miles, over which it roars and foams with the impetuosity of a torrent. It is not
till within a few miles of Lake Superior that it becomes still and deep. The entire
length of the river may be estimated at one hundred miles. It has two hundred
and forty distinct rapids, at some of which the river sinks its level from eight to
ten feet. It cannot fall, in this distance, less than 500. That it should ever have
been used in the fur trade, is to be explained by the fact that it has much water.</p>

are more closely scrutinized, they do not appear to denote a higher degree of
civilization than may be assigned to the ancestors of the present races of Indians,
prior to the epoch of the introduction of European arts into America. Certainly
there is nothing in our earthworks and mounds, to compare with the Toltec and
Aztec type of arts at the opening of the 16th century; while the possession by our
tribes of the zea maize, a tropical plant, and other facts indicative of a southern
migration, appear to denote a residence in warmer latitudes. The distribution of
the Mexican teocalli and pyramid is also plainly traceable from the south. Neither
the platform nor the solid conical mound has been traced higher north than Prairie
du Chien; nor have the earthworks (adopting Carver's notices) reached higher
than Lake Pepin. There are no mounds or earthworks at the sources of the Mississippi
nor in all British America to the shores of the Arctic Seas. We cannot bring

reputed to be the oldest settlement in that State. This city is eligibly situated on
a broad plateau, between limestone cliffs. The soil rests on a rock foundation,
which renders it incapable of being undermined by the Mississippi. Its streets
are broad and laid out at right angles. It has several Protestant churches, a
Catholic cathedral, a public land office, two banks, four printing offices, and by the
last census contains a population of 7,500, the county of which it is the seat of justice,
has 10,840. Two railroads have their terminal points at this place. At the
time of my visit, in 1820, the house which had been built by Mr. Dubuque, had
been burnt down; and there was not a dwelling superior to the Indian wigwam
within the present limits of Iowa. The State of Iowa was admitted into the Union
in 1837. By the 7th U. S. census, the population of this State, in 1850, is shown
to be 192,214. The number of square miles is 50,914. No Western State is believed
to contain a less proportionate quantity of land unsuited to the plough, and
its population and resources must have a rapid development.</p>

Mississippi, which permits steamboats freely to enter, converting the place into a
commercial depot for a vast surrounding country. Not less than 40,000,000 pounds
of lead were shipped from this place in 1852, valued at one million six hundred
thousand dollars. It is the terminus of the Chicago and Galena Railroad, connecting
it by a line of 180 miles with the lakes. It contains a bank, three newspaper
offices, and several churches of various denominations, and has, by the census of

was removed from the peninsula to the island, about 1780, the bones of the missionary
were transferred to the old Catholic burial-ground, in the village on the
island. There they remained till a land or property question arose to agitate the
church, and, when the crisis happened, the whole graveyard was disturbed, and his
bones, with others, were transferred to the Indian village of La Crosse, which is in
the vicinity of L'Arbre Croche, Michigan.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_151" id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="label">[151]</a> Major Robert A. Forsyth was a native of the Detroit Country, of Canadian descent,
and born a few years after its transfer to the United States. At the time of
the expedition, he was the Secretary of Governor Cass, and was admirably qualified
to take a part in it, by his energy and perseverance, his indomitable courage, and
his physical power and activity. Some of these traits of character were developed
at an early age. He was but yet a lad at the time of the surrender of Detroit, and
was so much excited by that untoward event, that he insulted the British officers in
the fort by his reproaches, and so irritated them that one of them threatened to pin
him to the floor with a bayonet. During the war upon the frontier, he was actively
employed, and on more than one occasion distinguished himself by his conduct and
courage. He was with Major Holmes at the battle near the Long Woods, and behaved
with great gallantry. In 1814, he was sent with Chandruai, a half-breed Pottowatamie,
and with a small party of Indians, to invite the various Indian tribes to
come to Greenville, at the treaties about to be held by Generals Harrison and Cass,
with a view to detach the North-Western Indians from British influence. On the
route, they met a superior party of Indians, led by an officer of the British Indian
Department, who attempted to take them prisoners. They resisted, and, by their
prompt and almost desperate courage, drove off the British party. Forsyth distinguished
himself in the contest, in which the British leader of the party was killed.
Soon after the war, he was appointed Private Secretary to Governor Cass, and continued
in that capacity for fifteen years, till the latter was transferred to the War
Department. He accompanied the General in all his expeditions into the Indian
country, and rendered himself invariably useful, having a peculiar talent to control
the rough men who took part in these dangerous excursions. He was ultimately
appointed a paymaster in the army, in which capacity he served in Mexico, where
he acquired the seeds of the disorder which proved fatal to him in 1849. He will
be long recollected and regretted by those who knew him, for the shining qualities
of head and heart which endeared him to all his acquaintances.</p>

clumsy, formal, and used to the comforts of good quarters and shelter,
they flinch under the activities and fatigue of forest life, and particularly of that
kind of life and toil, which consists in the management of canoes, and the carrying
forward canoes and baggage over bad portages, and conducting these frail vessels
over dangerous rapids and around falls. No amount of energy is sufficient on the
part of the officers to make them keep up, on these trips, with the gay, light, and
athletic <i>voyageur</i>, who unites the activity and expertness of the Indian with the
power of endurance of the white man. Lieut. Allen deserves great credit, as an
army officer, for urging his men forward as well as he did on this arduous journey, for
they were a perpetual cause of delay and anxiety to me and to him. They were
relieved and aided by my men at every practicable point; but, having the responsibility
of performing a definite duty, on a fixed sum of money, with many
men to feed in the wilderness, it was imperative in me to push on with energy, day
in and day out, and to set a manful example of diligence, at every point; and, instead
of carping at my rapidity of movement, as he does in his official report of
the ascent of the St. Croix, he having every supply within himself, and being, moreover,
in a friendly tribe, where there was no danger from Indian hostilities, he
should not have evinced a desire to control my encampments, but rather given his
men to understand that he could not countenance their dilatoriness.</p>

that bestowed on a mountain range in Orange and Ulster Counties, New York,
lying south of the Catskills, where it is sometimes called, for short, Shongum.

<p><a name="Footnote_215" id="Footnote_215" href="#FNanchor_215" class="label">[215]</a> The name, as pronounced by the Indians, is Mich-en-i-mack-in-ong, meaning

London, read before this Society in June, 1837, some of its most striking fossils are
figured and described, with references to the prior discoveries of Dr. Bigsby, Captain
Bayfield, and Dr. Richardson. Six new species of the Arctinoceras, and five of the
Huronia, Ormoceras, and Orthocerata, are figured and described in the most splendid
manner. This memoir is essential to all who would understand its fossil history,
and that of the North generally.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_219" id="Footnote_219" href="#FNanchor_219" class="label">[219]</a> In 1825, Lieutenant Charles F. Morton, U. S. A., sent to my office a mass of
this red sand rock, of about twelve inches diameter, perfectly round and ball-shaped,
which he had directed one of the soldiers to pick up, in an excursion among the
islands of the lower St. Mary's. This ball was a monument of that physical throe
which had originally carried this river through the sandstone pass of St. Mary's,
having been manifestly rounded in what geologists have called "a pocket hole" in
the rock at the falls, and afterwards carried away, with the disrupted rocks, down
the valley.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_220" id="Footnote_220" href="#FNanchor_220" class="label">[220]</a> The Indiana call it <i>Pauwateeg</i> (water leaping on the rocks), when speaking of
the phenomenon, and <i>Pawating</i>, when referring to the place of it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_221" id="Footnote_221" href="#FNanchor_221" class="label">[221]</a> During a subsequent residence of eleven years at this point, the excavations
made on both sides of the river, in digging wells, canals made by the military, &amp;c.,
fully demonstrated the truth of this general observation. In these positions, it was
evident that some greatly superior force of watery removal, such as does not now
exist, had heaped together particles of similar matters, according to laws which
govern moving, compacted masses of water, leaving clay to settle according to the
laws of diffused clay, sand of sand, and pebbles and boulders of pebbles and
boulders. In their change and redeposit, gravity has evidently been the primary
cause, modified by compressed currents, attraction, and probably those secret and
still undeveloped magnetic and electric influences which exist in connection with
astronomical phenomena. That the earth's surface, "standing out of the water and
in the water," has been disrupted and preyed upon by oceanic power, no one, at
this day of geological illumination, will deny.</p>

metallurgic operations of the Lake Superior basin.</p>

prove that they were formally recognized by the United States before this very
recent period. By the French and British governments they were known soon after
the first settlements at Quebec and Albany (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1608, 1614), and subsequently
treated with. A band of warriors from Chegoimegon, on Lake Superior, under the
command of Waub Ojeag, or the White Fisher, was present at the taking of Fort
Niagara by Sir W. Johnston in 1759.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_242" id="Footnote_242" href="#FNanchor_242" class="label">[242]</a> At the time these sketches were written, no geological observations had been
made on this field, which has, at subsequent periods, been so elaborately described;
nor had the topic itself attracted much attention. I landed at New York, in the
ship Arethusa, from New Orleans, in the summer of 1819, and published, in that city,
in the fall of that year, an account of the lead-bearing rocks of Missouri, and their
supporting white sandstones, which rest, in horizontal deposits, on the primitive
formation of the St. Francis; bringing, at the same time, a rich collection of the
mineralogy of that region, which soon became known in private cabinets. This
became the cause of my employment, by the United States Government, to visit the
alleged copper mines on Lake Superior, as a member of the expedition to the
sources of the Mississippi. I left Oneida County, in the district remarked on, on
the 10th of April of that year, and reached the banks of the Niagara River on the
29th of that month. On returning from the sources of the Mississippi, I entered
the same region on the 17th of October, and reached Oneida on the 21st of the same
month. Prior to my visit to the Great West, I had dwelt some three years&mdash;namely,
1809, '10, '11, '12&mdash;in Oneida and Ontario counties. These were the opportunities
enjoyed, up to the period, for acquiring a knowledge of the geography
and geology of the country. Mr. A. Eaton's <i>Index to Geology</i>, published early in
